This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href="https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/" rel="nofollow">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href="https://yoast.com/" rel="nofollow">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/" rel="nofollow">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo" rel="nofollow">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href="https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/" rel="nofollow">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel="next"</code> and <code>rel="prev"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href="https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/" rel="nofollow">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href="https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/" rel="nofollow">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href="https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/" rel="nofollow">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href="https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/" rel="nofollow">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href="http://translate.yoast.com" rel="nofollow">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" rel="nofollow">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=''youtube-player'' type=''text/html'' width=''640'' height=''390'' src=''https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent'' allowfullscreen=''true'' style=''border:0;''></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" rel="nofollow">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" rel="nofollow">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

This should also avoid namespace problems.)</li>\n<li>Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every request.)</li>\n<li>Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the config?

You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP. Please use with care!!</li>\n<li>Update to Spanish translation, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Updated Swedish translation</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.3.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where log would not get updated after it had been cleared</li>\n<li>Do plugin setup in &#8216;init&#8217; action</li>\n<li>Small update to Spanish translation file, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.2.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>(WordPress 3.0+) An invalid cookie can sometimes get sent multiple times before it gets cleared, resulting in multiple failed attempts or even a lockout from a single invalid cookie. Store the latest failed cookie to make sure we only count it as one failed attempt</li>\n<li>Define &#8220;Text Domain&#8221; correctly</li>\n<li>Include correct Dutch tranlation file.

Thanks to Johannes Ruthenberg for the report that prompted this</li>\n<li>Removed auth cookie admin check for version 2.7.</li>\n<li>Make sure relevant values in $_COOKIE get cleared right away on auth cookie validation failure. There are still some problems with cookie auth handling. The lockout can trigger prematurely in rare cases, but fixing it is plugin version 2 stuff unfortunately.</li>\n<li>Changed default time for retries to reset from 24 hours to 12 hours. The security impact is very minor and it means the warning will disappear &#8220;overnight&#8221;</li>\n<li>Added question to FAQ (&#8220;Why not reset failed attempts on a successful login?&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Updated screenshots</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverted minor cookie-handling cleanup which might somehow be responsible for recently reported cookie related lockouts</li>\n<li>Added version 1.x Brazilian Portuguese translation, thanks to Luciano Passuello</li>\n<li>Added Finnish translation, thanks to Ari Kontiainen</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Further multisite &amp; WPMU support (again thanks to <a href="mailto:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x40;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x73;&#x68;&#111;&#115;t&#x69;&#x6e;&#103;&#046;c&#x6f;&#x6d;" rel="nofollow">&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x40;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x73;&#x68;&#111;&#115;t&#x69;&#x6e;&#103;&#046;c&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>)</li>\n<li>Better error handling if option variables are damaged</li>\n<li>Added Traditional Chinese translation, thanks to Denny Huang <a href="mailto:&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#101;&#x78;&#112;&#x6c;&#111;&#114;&#x61;&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#064;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#101;&#x78;&#112;&#108;&#x6f;&#114;&#x61;&#116;&#x69;&#111;n&#x73;&#046;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#046;t&#x77;" rel="nofollow">&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#101;&#x78;&#112;&#x6c;&#111;&#114;&#x61;&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#064;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#101;&#x78;&#112;&#108;&#x6f;&#114;&#x61;&#116;&#x69;&#111;n&#x73;&#046;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#046;t&#x77;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.0</li>\n<li>Handle 3.0 login page failure &#8220;shake&#8221;</li>\n<li>Basic multisite support (parts thanks to <a href="mailto:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x40;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x73;&#x68;&#111;&#115;t&#x69;&#x6e;&#103;&#046;c&#x6f;&#x6d;" rel="nofollow">&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x40;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x6b;&#x73;&#x68;&#111;&#115;t&#x69;&#x6e;&#103;&#046;c&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Dutch translation, thanks to Bjorn Wijers <a href="mailto:b&#117;&#x72;&#111;&#x62;&#x6a;&#111;&#x72;n&#064;&#x62;&#117;&#x72;&#x6f;&#098;&#x6a;&#111;&#114;&#x6e;&#046;&#x6e;l" rel="nofollow">b&#117;&#x72;&#111;&#x62;&#x6a;&#111;&#x72;n&#064;&#x62;&#117;&#x72;&#x6f;&#098;&#x6a;&#111;&#114;&#x6e;&#046;&#x6e;l</a></li>\n<li><a href="mailto:&#098;&#097;&#x6c;&#x69;&#110;&#116;&#x40;v&#101;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#107;&#x75;&#x74;&#105;&#046;&#x69;n&#102;&#x6f;" rel="nofollow">&#098;&#097;&#x6c;&#x69;&#110;&#116;&#x40;v&#101;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#107;&#x75;&#x74;&#105;&#046;&#x69;n&#102;&#x6f;</a></li>\n<li>Added French translation, thanks to oVa <a href="mailto:&#111;&#118;&#x61;&#x31;&#x33;l&#097;&#115;&#x74;&#x61;&#x72;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#109;" rel="nofollow">&#111;&#118;&#x61;&#x31;&#x33;l&#097;&#115;&#x74;&#x61;&#x72;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Turkish translation, thanks to Yazan Canarkadas</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect admin page update using wp_nonce</li>\n<li>Added Czech translation, thanks to Jakub Jedelsky</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Bulgarian translation, thanks to Hristo Chakarov</li>\n<li></li>\n<li>Added Spanish translation, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Added Persian translation, thanks to Mostafa Soufi</li>\n<li>Added Russian translation, thanks to Jack Leonid (http://studio-xl.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Catalan translation, thanks to Robert Buj</li>\n<li>Added Romanian translation, thanks to Robert Tudor</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for getting the correct IP for clients while server is behind reverse proxy, thanks to Michael Skerwiderski</li>\n<li>Added German translation, thanks to Michael Skerwiderski</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No longer replaces pluggable function when cookie handling active.

free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="font-weight: 400">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400">448 translators

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">Bridget Willard <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href="https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href="https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:373:"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly?

Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Even More Developer Happiness <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like “Add New” links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Previously, if a user had created some paragraph blocks in Gutenberg but switched to the classic editor, the tags would get stripped out, making those blocks invalid when moving back to Gutenberg. Version 1.2 merges a pull request that detects whether the post contains blocks and then disables the wpautop behavior in the classic editor to prevent it from stripping the tags.</p>\n<p>This release also offers initial <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2740" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for postmeta</a> in block attributes. Gutenberg contributor Gary Pendergast tweeted <a href="https://gist.github.com/pento/19b35d621709042fc899e394a9387a54" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an example plugin</a> for those who want to experiment with it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just between us, the new Gutenberg 1.2 release includes the first version of postmeta support!

The <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">metabox placeholder shell</a> currently sits beneath the content with a &#8220;coming soon&#8221; message.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-10.56.48-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Developer Ross Wintle <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2800#issuecomment-332573684" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commented</a> on the pull request with a few concerns about the naming and placement of this panel with notes on how it might impact interfaces that have required meta fields:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\na) Meta boxes currently have several places that they can live: in the sidebar, below post content with different priorities and contexts<br />\nb) I also have cases where I&#8217;ve improved the editing experience for my users by having meta boxes above or below the title because this fits with their content editing flow.<br />\nc) I really don&#8217;t like the &#8220;Extended settings&#8221; title. For some editing workflows the information in meta boxes is actually critical, core content/settings, not something optional/added-on/extended. Is this editable? Can developers add additional sections of their own like this?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella acknowledged these concerns as legitimate and said the team is still exploring different options for the panel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first iteration, we&#8217;ll probably keep the collapsed state but have multiple areas,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;There are some good design proposals dropping the expanding area (for the content area) and replacing them with &#8220;separators,&#8221; which might be <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-312804592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">good as a v2</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It may have seemed like Gutenberg development has been on hold due to the delayed JavaScript framework decision, but development is still ongoing. It slowed over the past couple weeks while most of the project&#8217;s chief contributors were attending the Automattic GM.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The framework decision doesn’t affect most Gutenberg development work &#8211; because the framework is hidden behind a compatibility layer, the majority of development work (at least, the work that touches the UI) can talk to the compatibility layer,&#8221; contributor Gary Pendergast said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are also large areas of code that don’t need the framework at all. For example, adding <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2740" rel="noopener" target="_blank">postmeta support</a> was just about writing the glue between the Block API and the REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said that even once a JavaScript framework decision is made, Gutenberg will only require one or two developers to work on the necessary changes, but all other contributors will be able to continue on without any issues.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 04:21:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:111:"WPTavern: DigitalOcean Partners with GitHub to Support Open Source Projects during Hacktoberfest October 1–31";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75163";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"https://wptavern.com/digitalocean-partners-with-github-to-support-open-source-projects-during-hacktoberfest-october-1-31";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2705:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-12.29.22-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>DigitalOcean is organizing its fourth annual <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a> in partnership with GitHub.

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Have you ever done this?</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/file-versions.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Most of us have.</p>\n<p>Do you know what the technical term for it is? <em>Version control</em>. Your own, homemade, delicious implementation of version control!</p>\n<p>Okay, how about this?</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/commented-code.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version control right there!</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to show with these two examples is that all developers use some sort of version control. Some use Ctrl-z to roll back to a previous version, some use a zipped backup in a Dropbox folder and some use a dedicated version control system (VCS), such as Git. All the things we are trying to accomplish by backing up our files, commenting out old code and stashing it away in another “final-FINAL” zipball has been taken care of already. All we need to do is to embrace these VCS tools that we have available in our tool belt.</p>\n<p>Git is not complicated to use. It might seem difficult and overwhelming but in your day to day life you will probably use a maximum of 3-4 different commands. Learning how to use 3-4 commands to properly have version control of every single change ever made to your code base is a great deal compared to the “final-FINAL” approach.</p>\n<p>Here’s what version control looks like:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/version-control-intro.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is a screenshot of the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress Git mirror on GitHub</a>. Every time a change is made to the code base, it is recorded with Git and there is no need to copy the whole code base, throwing it into another folder, zipping it and naming it “final-FINAL-F-I-N-A-L”. If you dive into the WordPress code base on GitHub, you can find <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/23f1a9d2a4e9b484290f130e6c80e38e7fdcd453" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commits dating back to 2003</a>, made by “someone” named saxmatt!</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into one of these commits, as they are called in Git:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/commit.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is the diff (Git jargon for difference between 2 commits) for the “class-wp-widget-text.php” file. The red line is being replaced with the green line below it. No need to comment it out to save it for eternity, like in that other example. Git will do that for us and we can forever and always refer back to this commit to see what was replaced and with what.</p>\n<p>Of course, the full WordPress code base is a large project with many collaborators. However, no project is too small to benefit from Git. Once you master those 3-4 commands, using Git in your day-to-day developer life becomes second nature, just like hitting Ctrl-s. It might not be obvious right now, but when you pull out an old project months or years later, having version control helps you catch up and gives you the confidence to change things without fearing disaster.</p>\n<p>So I challenge you to learn Git! Not necessarily deeply, just a little bit.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 22:31:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: WordCamp Incubator Program Gears Up for Round 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75159";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-gears-up-for-round-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2791:"<p>Last year the WordPress Community Team launched an experimental <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-launch-experimental-wordcamp-incubator-program" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordCamp Incubator program</a> to bring WordCamps to new cities where meetups had not been very well established. After receiving 182 applications, organizers narrowed the selections to three cities with the most potential to foster an emerging WordPress community. Successful WordCamps were held in Denpasar, Harare, and Medellín. Six additional communities that applied to the program ended up organizing WordCamps as well with the help of community mentors.</p>\n<p>This week Andrea Middleton announced that the Community Team will be pursuing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">round two of the WordCamp Incubator program</a>. Given the rapid growth of the global WordPress community, Middleton said the greatest challenge to getting the program running again is finding people who can oversee the new WordCamps. The full-time sponsored volunteer staff from the previous year is already fully committed for 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a time-intensive volunteer role,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;We estimate that lead organizers spend about 170 hours on a WordCamp, and I figure that the folks working to support the growth of an Incubator event need to dedicate about 200-250 hours over the planning cycle. The job is that of co-organizer, mentor, and ambassador — since it’s probable that no one you’re working with has ever actually attended a WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Experience having organized WordCamps is a prerequisite for taking on the community advisor role. Middleton also emphasized the importance of sensitivity and experience collaborating with people from other cultures. She estimates the volunteer role is likely to require 25 hours per month. As this is almost a part-time job, the Community Team is looking at the possibility of having interested volunteers pitch their companies to sponsor some of their hours to work on the incubator program. They are also considering creating a team of incubator advisors to work together assisting multiple communities.</p>\n<p>The team is aiming to decide on a name for the advisor role and come up with a plan for recruiting volunteers by October 6. This will be followed by a call for communities that would like to be considered for the program and host their first WordCamp in 2018.

This access is, however, is limited to the specific user who connected. Multiple users on a site will each need to authenticate separately and can connect their own Google accounts. The users do not have access to each other&#8217;s photos.

Our admin setup is complex, so switching to editing here isn’t an option. I have multiple contributors who write directly and this would be a game changer if they could directly upload their images from their account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A WordPress.com representative confirmed that there are currently no plans to support a standalone version in Jetpack.

Brad is the Co-Founder and CEO of the website design and development agency <a href="https://webdevstudios.com">WebDevStudios</a>.</p>\n<p>He is also a co-author of the Professional WordPress book series. Brad is a US Marine Corps veteran and has been developing websites for over 20 years, including the last 10 where he has focused on open-source technologies like WordPress.</p>\n<hr />\n<img />Brad Williams at Camp Press\n<p>I’ve been to a number of WordCamps and tech-related events over the years. They all follow a similar pattern of speakers, panels, sponsors, after-parties, etc. We’ve all been to these types of events and generally know what to expect; so when <a href="https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mendel Kurland</a> pitched the idea of <a href="https://camp.press/">Camp Press</a> to me as &#8216;geeks camping,&#8217; I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>I went to Camp Press with no idea of what to expect. I honestly have never felt less prepared for an event as I did for this one. I like to plan. So, going to an event where I wasn’t 100% sure how it would work had me feeling nervous. What I soon realized is that I liked being pushed out of my &#8216;safety bubble.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The Camp Press location was absolutely amazing and truly helped make the event special. We stayed at a large summer camp style setup, about an hour outside of Oklahoma City called Fry Lake. If you aren’t familiar with Oklahoma, just imagine driving an hour from a large city to the middle of nowhere. Perfect.</p>\n<p>Fry Lake had cabins, shower and bathroom facilities, an amazing swimming lake with diving boards, and a full cafeteria kitchen. We were literally back at the type of summer camp we experienced as kids, and we immediately knew it.</p>\n<img />Camp Press Fire\n<p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p>\n<p>Even more amazing is that nothing was scripted. There was no agenda, set activities, presentations. It was just natural interaction. Over the course of a few days, we all grew closer to each other. There was an unspoken bond forming between everyone at Camp Press.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect going to <a href="https://camp.press/">Camp Press</a>. What I promptly learned is that was the entire point of the event—doing the unexpected, pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, making new friends, having fun and serious conversations, and doing all of this without the normal technology that is always around us.</p>\n<p>When is the last time you had a detox from digital life?

I think it was a pre-owned old beaten Compaq Deskpro 386. We only stopped arguing once we could sit down together and play Civ; one of us at the controls, the others giving advice on what moves to make.</p>\n<h3>Dipping Into The Web</h3>\n<p>I learnt HTML and built my first pages on Geocities and out of necessity: I needed a place to publish my angsty teenage poetry. But people didn’t come to my website for the bad poetry, instead they filled my guestbook with webdesign and HTML questions.</p>\n<p>I have built websites for myself and others since the mid 90’s and kept a few clients on the side while studying. At this time, there was not a lot of computer or programming classes available for high school students. It had been easy enough to learn HTML online by reading guides, message boards and similar. During one of my final semesters, my school announced a new class called “Computers for girls”. I signed up hoping to learn enough to assemble or upgrade my own PC. The class was a joke. Instead of teaching us about motherboards, memory or networks, our teacher showed us where to put the cords…</p>\n<p>He didn’t realise that most of us already spent every recess in the computer halls, chatting over IRC. In order to learn the basics of actual programming (not just HTML), I had to take adult education evening- and summer classes since my school didn’t offer any.</p>\n<h3>Derailed</h3>\n<p>After high school I did like many others of my generation: I fell in love with someone I had only met online, who lived on the other side of the world. All to the soundtrack of Savage Garden&#8217;s “I Knew I Loved You”.</p>\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>\n<p>It took all my savings and courage to travel back and forward between Sweden and the US, while studying from a distance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When my boyfriend suddenly passed away in 2001 I had to make drastic changes in my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was in the middle of moving, I couldn’t keep up with deadlines or deal with clients, and I was barely able to finish my project managing and programming classes. I had to forget all our plans, start over, and take a desk job instead.</p>\n<h3>Coming Back To The Web</h3>\n<p>Many years later one of my former clients asked if I had tried WordPress. It took me a few months to decide if I liked it or not, partially because I didn’t know PHP, and because I didn’t have great experiences from trying Joomla and Drupal.</p>\n<p>I did some customization work and eventually I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Of course my theme was a mess and did not even work as expected.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I appreciated that someone took the time to look at my code and explain what I needed to do to fix it and where I could read more. It was very rare to receive such feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I joined the Theme Review Team&#8217;s mailing list, listening in and learning. I started reviewing themes to learn more and to improve my own themes.</p>\n<p>For those who do not know what the Theme Review Team does, we test and review the code (every single file) of themes that are submitted to be included in the WordPress.org theme directory.</p>\n<h3>My Secret Power</h3>\n<p>Because I am on the autism spectrum, the structure and patterns of coding languages suits me well. I need both structure and a creative outlet in my life, and coding is therapy, much like a puzzle or a coloring book. I love my once dreaded desk job, because it gives me the opportunity to help people on a different scale than I ever could as a freelancer. Being a volunteer on WordPress.org lets me combine both worlds.</p>\n<p>I could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life, that I would spend this much time on it (sometimes up to 20 hours per week), or that I would be asked to be one of the team leads for the Theme Review Team in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today I honestly don’t know what I would do if I could no longer contribute to WordPress the way I know and am familiar with. It is an essential part of my everyday life.</p>\n<p>WordPress is also challenging because you can only do so much without interacting with others… And even though I find that difficult, I have had to learn that it is something I need as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have to remind myself from time to time that here, I am allowed to be myself, with all my flaws, to contribute as much or as little as I choose, at my own pace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And to be able to contribute and to help others, I also have to remind myself that people are not scary.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was a volunteer online for 6 years before I had the courage to go to my first WordCamp, which took place in my own home town. When I was finally there, I only spoke to 3 or 4 people. My second WordCamp went better, but the experience was still overwhelming.</p>\n<p>During my third WordCamp, which was WCEU 2017, I helped lead the Theme Review section of the contributor day, having to speak in front of 500 people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thing is, even when it overwhelms you, this community and its energy is addicting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everything changes once you go to your first meetup or WordCamp, meeting people who share your interest and passion. The community at large is open and welcoming, passionate, curious and caring. And it is trying to be a safe place for us all.</p>\n<h3>The Theme Review Team</h3>\n<p>There always seem to be a lot of opinions and even controversy surrounding the Theme Review Team. It is not always easy to handle the pressure and the amount of responsibility that is placed on you because so many people have a financial interest in WordPress themes. As a team lead or moderator, you often have to try to find the least bad solution to many different kind of situations.</p>\n<p>By the end of September, it is time for the current team leads to step back and welcome our next leads. I am looking forward to the break, but also to see what new ideas they will bring.<br />\nIt takes time to change a system that has been in place for this many years, and truthfully, sometimes it is painfully slow. It has proven difficult to find a system where themes without errors can be added to the directory quickly, and where reviewers can support authors who need extra help.</p>\n<p>This amazing team of volunteers has managed to reduce the queue time from 7 months down to 8-10 weeks. We still hope to be able to reduce it further, possibly by automating parts of the code review.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Theme Review Team is open to everyone and always looking for new volunteers.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Challenge Gladly Accepted" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Challenge%20Gladly%20Accepted&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Challenge Gladly Accepted" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F&title=Challenge+Gladly+Accepted" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Challenge Gladly Accepted"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/092717-150x150.jpg&description=Challenge Gladly Accepted" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Challenge Gladly Accepted"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/" title="Challenge Gladly Accepted"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/">Challenge Gladly Accepted</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 00:00:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Carolina Nymark";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"WPTavern: WordPress Core JavaScript Framework Selection Discussion Continues with Input from Open Source Community Leaders";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75086";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:133:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-selection-discussion-continues-with-input-from-open-source-community-leaders";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10632:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javascript.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel hosted a lively and productive meeting this morning led by Andrew Duthie. The discussion focused less on specific framework comparisons and more on the role a framework will play in building JavaScript-powered interfaces for WordPress. Contributors were joined by core developers and leaders from the React and Vue communities, Chrome engineers, and other interested parties from outside the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This chat will focus largely on identifying requirements in building core features, overlap with plugin and theme authors, and patterns to reducing framework lock-in,&#8221; Duthie said. &#8220;Ideally this is higher-level than simply debating the merits of specific frameworks in a vacuum, and should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate between projects to set a path forward for WordPress which will provide flexibility and resiliency to future churn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duthie began by asking what role a framework should play in a WordPress developer&#8217;s workflow and also asked framework contributors to offer their perspectives on recommendations for extendable interfaces. This question provided attendees with the opportunity to weigh in on topics such as <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for web components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> for Gutenberg, and how this might affect WordPress&#8217; plugin ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I disagree a bit with the idea that whatever core (in this case Gutenberg) uses to power some of the intricacies of building a stateful app is going to be the de facto standard for plugin development,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura said. &#8220;The actual framework here, in general terms, is going to be what WordPress exposes and the APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks, the library that core decides to build on doesn&#8217;t have to become the de facto standard for plugin developers but many outside the Gutenberg team believe that it will inevitably end up that way in practice. There are entire teams of engineers waiting on this decision that are committed to adopt whichever framework WordPress bets on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To provide some perspective on how WP’s decision on a framework impacts developers downstream, I’m a developer at Boston University and our plan is to focus on whichever framework WP decides upon, even if Gutenberg has a completely agnostic API,&#8221; Adam Pieniazek said. &#8220;We’re primarily a WP shop (~ 1,000 site WP install powers most/a lot of our public web presence) and end up creating huge customizations on top of WP that often require diving into core to see what is actually happening in the background. I like Vue more than React personally, but if WP decides upon React, BU will focus on building expertise in React for when we need to peek/debug beyond the API. It doesn’t mean we won’t also use Vue but it won’t be our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieniazek feedback echoes that of Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock, who said his team is ready to adopt whatever library WordPress selects.</p>\n<p>“People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,” Hancock said in the #core-js channel earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Many participants from outside the WordPress community seemed to be in agreement with a framework-agnostic approach and none were eager to force a single framework on all developers working with WordPress. The remaining concern is how this works out practically and whether it puts developers in the confusing position of using a framework on top of a framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Gutenberg itself is going to become a platform to build for, the best level of separation is if the framework is used to build the core, but isn’t exposed as API to block builders,&#8221; AMP engineer Paul Bakaus said. &#8220;This gives one the choice to replace the underlying foundation whenever necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella summarized the approach the team has been discussing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think what we try to communicate is something like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; WordPress Core is going to use this X framework internally<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use it, we think it’s good<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use something else, you can just as easily as you’d use the Core’s chosen framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Benguella also said that one of the goals for Gutenberg is &#8220;to set the basis for how we extend WordPress&#8217; UI in the future.&#8221; Once it ships, the team will likely set its sights on other parts of the wp-admin and build them in the same way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all parts of WP’s UI can be extended via a standard interface, whether it be a simple &#8216;data down, events up&#8217; API, or expecting a WC, I think this would cleanly separate the concerns of &#8216;what framework to use for core&#8217; vs. &#8216;what framework to use for extension development,''&#8221; Vue.js creator Evan You said.</p>\n<p>When asked for his thoughts on on React becoming a primary framework for WordPress, React maintainer Dan Abromov was hesitant to advocate for WordPress adopting the library. His response underscored the necessity of having a framework-agnostic approach for extending Gutenberg and future WP interface overhauls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know WordPress well, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether it&#8217;s a great fit for the use case or not,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;Generally we use React for highly interactive UIs and find that it scales well with the app size. I&#8217;m also happy to answer technical questions about it. But I think in general people have strong opinions about, for example, templating vs expressiveness, and I don&#8217;t feel like forcing React upon everyone is the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel the same way,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;Forcing a single framework on everyone, regardless of which one, is IMO not a good idea because it is bound to alienate the group of devs who are not into that framework, and imposes a bigger long term stability risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also said that people are already &#8220;very bitter and divisive&#8221; about the subject of selecting a framework. He also tweeted a similar sentiment prior to the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I read discussion threads (e.g. about WordPress) there’s a sense that people perceive every team as hostile to others.

It’s just a matter of proper implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants referenced <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">custom-elements-everywhere.com</a>, a site that displays popular JS frameworks&#8217; progress on communicating Custom Elements in a way that promotes interoperability. Matías Ventura asked React and Vue core devs how web components (and their future) fit into each framework at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In React, we have some web component support but haven&#8217;t made it a large priority since use cases have seemed slim in the past, especially since adding Web Components hasn&#8217;t made a lot of sense in a first-party application where you control the whole stack – but we do have some support for them nonetheless and I&#8217;m happy to entertain adding more, either now or in the future,&#8221; Sophie Alpert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the high level I think frameworks like React/Vue provide what is not really addressed in web components: efficient and declarative DOM updates reacting to state changes,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;This is also why Polymer exists on top of WC. I have always acknowledged the value of WC as an interop interface.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, attendees at the meeting were respectful, collaborative, and eager to contribute their expertise to help WordPress contributors find the best way forward in the framework selection process. The discussion will continue at next week&#8217;s meeting and likely in the comments of a forthcoming Make/Core post summarizing the meeting.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:16:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Spam Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75059";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"https://wptavern.com/si-captcha-anti-spam-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-og-due-to-spam-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4092:"<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a> plugin has been removed from the WordPress Directory due to its author including spam code. The plugin added a CAPTCHA image test to WordPress forms to prevent spam and was compatible with forms generated by bbPress, BuddyPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. It had more than 300,000 active installs at the time of removal.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikechallis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mike Challis</a>, the original author of the plugin, said that a WordPress.org user named &#8220;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fastsecure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fastsecure</a>&#8221; became the new owner of SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam in June 2017. Challis was not aware of the new owner&#8217;s plans for the plugin but <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a notice</a> on the WordPress.org support forums to inform users about why it was removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new owner attempted to put code in several of his newly acquired WordPress plugins that would connect to a 3rd party server he also owned and place spam ads for payday loans and such in the WP posts,&#8221; Challis said. He also linked the incident to a ring of WordPress plugins that researchers at Wordfence say were part of a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/coordinated-plugin-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coordinated spam campaign</a>. Display Widgets, one of the most notable plugins in this group, was recently <a href="https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code" rel="noopener" target="_blank">permanently removed from WordPress.org</a> for a series of violations wherein the author had injected malicious code.</p>\n<p>Challis said the new owner failed to display any spam on sites due to how the code was implemented, but the code could have been activated at a later time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new owner put spam code in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 but it failed to display any spam because he put the code in the secureimage.php file. The malicious code required WordPress libraries to also be loaded to execute. The reason the spam code did not do anything at all is because the secureimage.php file is not included in the WordPress run time environment. The secureimage.php file is included from another file securimage_show.php that loads the captcha image directly from html img src outside of the WordPress run time. The spam code in this plugin was never activated, it would not have corrupted your posts or changed anything in the WordPress database.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam users who still have the plugin installed may see an update available in the WordPress admin. Plugin team member Samuel (Otto) Wood removed the malicious code and <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released 3.0.3</a> as a clean version that is a safe update for users who still rely on the plugin. Wood recommends users find an alternative, because SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam will not be re-listed in the directory or receive any future updates.</p>\n<p>The incident is another reminder for users to be on alert when WordPress.org plugins change hands, as the buyers do not always disclose their actual intentions for the plugin.

React community members began rallying around a <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">petition to re-license React</a> after the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook’s engineering directors officially denied the request in mid-August, citing the burden of meritless patent litigation as the reason for keeping the patents clause.</p>\n<p>Facebook moved forward on this decision in full recognition that it might lose some React community members as a consequence. Many open source project maintainers began to look for alternatives. In a surprising move, Matt Mullenweg announced that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress would also be parting ways with React</a> and planned to remove it from the upcoming Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s decision to drop React from consideration for WordPress was likely an influential factor in Facebook&#8217;s eventual about-face on the topic of re-licensing the project. Facebook&#8217;s announcement on Friday acknowledges that the company failed to convince the open source community of the benefits of its BSD + Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don&#8217;t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons. </p>\n<p>This decision comes after several weeks of disappointment and uncertainty for our community. Although we still believe our BSD + Patents license provides some benefits to users of our projects, we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The React 16 release, slated for this week, will ship with the updated MIT license. Facebook declined to respond to our request for further comment and said their post is the only public statement they will be providing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress will continue on with React, picking up where the team left off on Gutenberg, or  shift to another library. Core contributors had originally <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/911356481936740352" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided on React</a> while attending WordPress&#8217; community summit in Paris last June, although this decision had not yet been made public when the greater open source community started petitioning Facebook to re-license React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m just so tired of this drama,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said. &#8220;We spent days and days thinking about the best framework for WP, and this change will just add more thinking, complexity, and uncertainty to our decision. I’m just tired of all this&#8230;we all have to rethink everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who had previously penned a several-thousand word unpublished announcement about how WordPress would be adopting React, did not confirm whether WordPress is still examining other libraries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our decision to move away from React, based on their previous stance, has sparked a lot of interesting discussions in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> published to his blog this weekend. &#8220;Particularly with Gutenberg there may be an approach that allows developers to write Gutenberg blocks (Gutenblocks) in the library of their choice including Preact, Polymer, or Vue, and now React could be an officially-supported option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The regularly scheduled core JavaScript meeting is set for Tuesday, September 26 at 15:00 GMT and contributors plan to discuss the role a JS framework will play in current and future core focuses.

I watched a presentation where the presenter had slides with 20+ different recommended tools on them, and not a single mention of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an eCommerce conference, WooCommerce is 41% of all eCommerce stores, and not a single person said the word WooCommerce. All I heard about was Shopify and Amazon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href="https://www.similartech.com/">SimilarTech</a>, WooCommerce is leading in the top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web while Shopify is leading in the top 10K sites. While Shopify has a lot less market share, it&#8217;s used on substantially higher trafficked sites.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared the perspective of a friend who uses Shopify to sell clothing and will gross more than $1M in revenue this year. According to his friend, Shopify is easy to use, from setting up a theme, to the plugin/app ecosystem to add functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When my friend said Shopify is easy to use, this is a whole different category of great user experience,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;This is building a site from scratch for a completely non-technical user, and them loving the end result and the experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger raised an interesting point in that, Wix, Shopify, and SquareSpace are closed, SaaS offerings where they can control the user experience from end-to-end. This is impossible to do with WordPress because there are too many moving parts and core can not control how plugins and themes take part in that experience.</p>\n<p>While WordPress core can&#8217;t necessarily solve the problem, it hasn&#8217;t stopped webhosts from trying. <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers">GoDaddy</a>,  <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/welcome-to-the-new-bluehost-8973/">Bluehost</a>, and others have created onboarding solutions that try to control the end-to-end user experience.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared a sentiment that many in the WordPress community have advocated in recent years. &#8220;If we’re honest, the strength of WordPress is not that it’s easy to use for non-technical people. It’s an open-source platform that is easy for developers to extend and customize for clients.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://mattreport.com/wordpress-is-not-easy/">WordPress is Not Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://mor10.com/wordpress-easy-thats-ok/">WordPress is not easy – and that’s OK</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://neliosoftware.com/blog/is-wordpress-as-easy-as-we-think/">Is WordPress As Easy As We Think?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a time, somewhere between WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 3.5, where one of the main reasons people used WordPress was because it was easy. Between then and now, what caused WordPress to lose its ease-of-use factor?</p>\n<p>SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify didn&#8217;t exist in the early days of WordPress, they were late to market.

One of the more recent topics is the possibility of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a> for Gutenberg, which would allow developers to extend the new editor using any JS library they prefer. This means that Gutenberg blocks, which are colloquially referred to as &#8220;Gutenblocks,&#8221; could be built with Vue, React, Preact, Angular, or whatever the developer feels comfortable using.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this idea contend that pursuing a more flexible approach makes WordPress&#8217; core JS framework decision <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463#issuecomment-330637007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less critical</a>. While answering questions on the #core-js channel, Gary Pendergast explained how Gutenberg could be built to maintain the separation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not joking when I say that this decision doesn&#8217;t matter, even for people contributing to Gutenberg,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;In <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2463</a>, the library is treated entirely as a utility library, much like we use lodash, for example. It performs a handful of tasks, and it can be relatively easily pulled out and replaced with something entirely different, with no disruption to the rest of the codebase. For people contributing to Gutenberg, they&#8217;re contributing in the Gutenberg coding style, not the style of whatever library we happen to import.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about a timeline for when the decision will be made and what factors are being considered, Pendergast replied that there is no timeline and that those interested in participating should blog about their experiences and write examples of things they can build with the JS frameworks they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is neither roadmap, nor timeline, nor does there need to be,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;As Matt mentioned, it&#8217;s really just a technical decision &#8211; the important decision for the wider community was choosing &#8216;not React.&#8217; Unfortunately, this decision has been blown way out of proportion, and heavily conflated with &#8216;what JS library will I be able to build my plugins with?&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;what JS library&#8217;s practices will Gutenberg blocks resemble?,&#8217; neither of which are related. Tweets and posts that treat it like a horse race are not helpful in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said whatever library is selected will &#8220;continue to be wrapped by the WordPress element, the underlying library won&#8217;t be exposed.&#8221; The Gutenberg team is working to remove all library dependencies from its components so that plugin developers can use any library they choose.</p>\n<p>However, other community members are not so eager to relegate the JS library selected for core to a simple technical decision or utility library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most developers understand that their plugins are not bound by the framework chosen for core/Gutenberg,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t diminish the significance of the decision. If we want to encourage more contributors, we&#8217;d be well served to choose a framework in which a significant majority feel capable and confident. If this majority is out there developing plugins with one framework and has to learn another in order to contribute to core, then we&#8217;re limiting the number of potential contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peter Booker contends that no matter how elegant Gutenberg&#8217;s separation is, having a decent understanding of the library chosen for core affects a developers&#8217; ability to deeply troubleshoot certain issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we should be so dismissive of the choice as a minor technical decision,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;Understanding how PHP, JavaScript, and Backbone (among other things) work is essential to be able to properly debug problems with WordPress. The JS framework chosen for Gutenberg is going to impact a great many people, even if we are not core contributors. It will be essential knowledge to be able to fully troubleshoot issues. This is a decision which will impact far more people than just the Gutenberg team.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of providing a flexible, framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks?</h3>\n<p>Jason Bahl asked if anyone has tried mixing React, Preact, Vue, and Angular in a single app to see if it is &#8220;a recipe for a performance nightmare.&#8221; He posed an example scenario wherein Gravity Forms builds Vue-based Gutenblocks, Yoast has React-based blocks, WooCommerce builds blocks with Preact, and another plugin uses Ember.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It sounds kind of nice to be flexible and allow folks to use whatever but also like it could lead to a lot of division on best practices, and potentially performance issues,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see tutorials pop up for how to build Gutenblocks in Vue, React, Preact, Ember, Vanilla JS, etc., which would be cool to see, but also confusing and potentially cause further divide in the community and accepted best practices. Flexibility is nice to a degree, but a strong opinion at some level is also good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carl Hancock, co-founder of Gravity Forms, contends that offering a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks will have little influence on developers who are extending the project. The decision cannot be made less critical by offering more flexibility, because developers will inevitably adopt whatever WordPress core uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;Which means however complex that core framework ends up being will have a direct impact on the barrier to entry for plugin and theme developers. That barrier to entry has been historically low to date and a direct contributor to the growth of WordPress as a self-hosted CMS. Dramatically raising that barrier to entry isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Gravity Forms will use Preact, Vue, whatever, because we have the manpower and skillset to do so when we can finally decide to do so once core makes it’s decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Opportunity to Advance the Web</h3>\n<p>WordPress currently powers 28% of all websites, according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W3 Techs</a>, and whatever framework it chooses will make a major impact on which library many developers decide to learn in order to extend the software and advance their careers.</p>\n<p>Matías Ventura, one of the technical leads on the Gutenberg project, encouraged participants in the discussion to look at the bigger picture and embrace the opportunity to work together and collaborate on a solution for WordPress that will advance the web. The team&#8217;s efforts to collaborate with representatives from competing frameworks stands apart in an ecosystem that is generally fragmented and fractious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m excited about the opportunity we have to advance web development in terms of JavaScript UI representation, in a similar way to how WordPress was a driving force for web standards during the past decade,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;That’s also where I see us having a responsibility as a project, as people will continue to learn web development through WP. Many people have been introduced to PHP through WordPress, originally just interacting with WP functions and APIs, eventually diving a bit more deeply into the language as needed. I do see our core remaining close to JS the language, as that gives the most meaningful tool to learn, spanning across all frameworks and libraries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura assured participants in the ongoing discussion that the Gutenberg team is listening and working towards a solution that will push the web forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are absolutely aware that how we build and what we offer through Gutenberg is going to affect the dev community and we are not taking this lightly—quite the opposite,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I’ve been talking with Evan (Vue) and Jason (Preact) because rather than having a &#8216;choose your framework&#8217; contest, this seems an opportunity to collaborate and push the web forwards.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:26:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: DonateWC Reaches Fundraising Goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75001";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-reaches-fundraising-goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1702:"<p><a href="https://donatewc.org/">DonateWC</a>, <a href="https://wptavern.com/donatewc-aims-to-provide-travel-sponsorships-to-attend-large-wordcamps">an initiative</a> focused on providing less fortunate people an opportunity to attend large WordCamps has <a href="https://donatewc.org/news/surprise-our-goal-is-fully-funded/">reached its fundraising goal</a> of 1,000€.

I was able to change the number of columns while editing the gallery, but the preview in the admin did not match the the way the gallery looks on the frontend. The number of columns is correct on the frontend but not in the admin preview. This might cause some confusion for users if it isn&#8217;t fixed before landing in core. Contributors to the plugin are looking at this <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues/190#issuecomment-331011895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-20-at-3.16.22-PM-e1505938641908.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is user-friendly and similar to adding galleries in posts and pages. However, the widget could still use some testing, especially with different plugins installed. For example, with Jetpack enabled, users can choose between a thumbnail and a slideshow gallery, but the slideshow option doesn&#8217;t seem to work correctly in the widget. WordPress.org has <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/gallery+widget/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several hundred plugins</a> that implement some sort of gallery widget and these plugin authors will want to test the new core widget.</p>\n<p>Theme authors will also need to test how the core gallery widget interacts with their themes. After testing the gallery widget with several popular WordPress.org themes, I found that many display the thumbnails with unsightly outlines and unpredictable spacing between images.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who authored the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dev note post</a> when the previous media widgets were introduced in 4.8, said that the paragraph regarding default theme updates is still applicable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes that add custom styles to the MediaElement.js player (namely Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Fourteen) were updated from just styling it within syndicated content, to also include instances within widgets. Most themes don’t restrict styles for captioned images or media players to just post content, that is, limit CSS selectors to classes output by post_class(). If your theme does, make sure to either remove that constraint or include a .widget selector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ruter said another dev note will be coming with common theme changes that are required to add the right styling for galleries. Users and theme/plugin developers can test the gallery widget right now on 4.8.2 or 4.9-alpha using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once the widget is added to WordPress, it will be deactivated in the feature plugin for future releases. Contributors plan to merge the new widget into core next week, provided testing goes well.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:35:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 288 – No React.js Framework for Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74933&preview=true&preview_id=74933";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-288-no-react-js-framework-for-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3046:"<p>While I was supposed to be on vacation last week, I instead had surgery for a broken ankle.

I had become a part of something bigger than myself." /><p>The first time I ever made a WordPress site, I got 180,000 views in 2 days, 253 comments, and (give or take) 7 death threats.</p>\n<p>It was 2014 and I was working on an MBA at Florida State University during the peak of the Jameis Winston controversy, where a football quarterback was accused of rape and protected from prosecution by the university and local police. I had used WordPress before, but not a lot. But, in true democratizing publishing, giving a voice to the voiceless fashion, when I had something I wanted to say, I knew just the thing to get it out there with minimal know-how: a free, single page WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p>I had just returned to Florida from a summer in New York City. To my amazement, I got the life-changing opportunity, paid for by the university’s College of Social Sciences paid, to go up there for a summer of exploration in the social entrepreneurship and technology circles after pitching Florida State on a concept for financial education.</p>\n<h3>Beginning the Journey</h3>\n<p>I had become interested in financial education around the age of 16, when my family became homeless for a month. My mom hadn’t been able to make the rent, so we got kicked out, and then couldn’t find an apartment easily due to my mom’s lack of credit. Later, I started working at a major commercial bank and met hundreds, if not thousands, of people in similar situations (and saw the ways in which major commercial banks don’t help these people, but that’s a different conversation).</p>\n<p>Imagine having been homeless at 16. Then, 6 years later, you’re attending graduate school, funded by the university, and that same university also paid for you to live in the country’s most expensive place for 3 months so that you could learn about executing your ideas on how to make a positive difference through technology entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>You would probably be overcome with gratefulness. But you would also likely be extremely protective of the people making such a thing possible.</p>\n<p>Now imagine, that while Florida State University’s programs making such an impact on you, a football player’s actions are driving the narrative of this place you want to be proud of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine me, telling the story I just told you, and watching people connect the dots between what institution was making all of this possible for me, and what they had heard of it. “Oh, my God, with the quarterback that raped that girl?” they would say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would link you to the page I created, but quite honestly, it wasn’t a lot more than a profanity-laden rant (of admittedly epic proportions). But, it got a reaction: she needs to shut the f**k up. She’s completely right. She’s an “attention-seeking whore!”. She’s the story we should be focusing on. She’s just upset her Kickstarter campaign failed.</p>\n<p>There it was: WordPress had amplified my voice, and everyone else’s, too.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress Business</h3>\n<p>Today, I’m the lesser-known half of Caldera Labs, makers of Caldera Forms, a top drag-and-drop form building plugin for WordPress. A few weeks ago, we got a one-star review on WordPress.org that called me out by name: “their team is useless, especially Christie Chirinos.” I received caring notes from several seasoned WordPress product developers, reassuring me that these things happen and I ought to not take it personally. “It’s not the first time someone’s been mean to me on the internet, and it probably won’t be the last,” I wrote in a Slack DM to my incredible business partner, the part of Caldera Labs you probably know, Josh Pollock. Josh laughed.</p>\n<p>My road from single-page rants on WordPress.com to WordPress product leadership was actually pretty straightforward, although certainly wrapped in incredible fortune. I kept up that blog for a few months at the request of some of those 253 people (and the dismay of some others). Eventually it was forgotten for my financial education project’s website, which went from Wix to self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some months of working on that site made me acutely aware that if I wanted to execute more of my ideas, I should learn more code. I started learning JavaScript and PHP. I met Josh somewhere around that time. He liked my WordPress.com story, and encouraged me to keep learning, while picking my brain on what my almost-finished MBA thought about Caldera Forms.</p>\n<p>A professor asked me if I would work on his academic WordPress website for a fee. I was a broke graduate student, so I said yes. Suddenly I had clients. When I graduated, Josh approached me with a proposal to join him in business. I said yes, but my only condition is that I’m moving back to New York City. Josh said, remote work is the norm.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-19_at_8.26.20_pm-1024x374.png" alt="Screen shot of Caldera website" width="960" height="351" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the quote-unquote “formal business education,” I was flabbergasted when the full weight of what a WordPress product business entailed hit me. I didn’t understand the community. I didn’t understand the niche’s culture. Much of what I learned were business norms, were completely non-existent in WordPress. I communicated all of this to Josh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have no idea what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t, you’ve never done this before.”</p>\n<p>He introduced me to the extensive library of talks on WordPress TV on imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Diving Into WordCamp</h3>\n<p>For me, it clicked at the inaugural WordCamp US. I showed up to the event looking like a deer caught in the headlights and was welcomed with open arms. I got to put faces to all of the names I had learned in the last half-year, and surprise: they were nice. They were welcoming. They were understanding.</p>\n<p>I scoffed at the idea that I would have anything to contribute on Contributor Day, and then found out that the polyglots team could totally use an immigrant that speaks 4 languages. More importantly, I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress. I realized that, by total accident (or perhaps completely on purpose), I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had to stick with it, no matter how hard it was.</p>\n<p>In the year after that, I also began to find a small niche for myself. I became “the girl with the MBA,” smart, young, and clearly lucky. “There’s not a lot of people in the space with your background,” said the host interviewing me on a WordPress podcast. Meanwhile, I’m thinking to myself, “oh my god. I don’t even understand why you invited me. I’m very grateful, but I also really don’t know that much about business. Didn’t you notice? Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p>\n<p>Move forward a year, and results started rolling in. I spoke at 4 WordCamps and many other shows. Josh published his 2016 Year In Review, where he outlined the explosive growth that Caldera Forms experienced at the end of the year and acknowledged the benefit of having partnered with me. He doesn’t know this, but I cried when I read that (now he knows).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was surreal: the unlikely thing that we set out to do was working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year, 2017, has consisted of taking on the next step in that process: teaching myself how to turn all of those thoughts on their heads. I have had to unlearn “why me?” and internalize “why not me?”, and most importantly, practice differentiating the story that I tell myself about myself versus the evidence-based reality.</p>\n<h3>Self Discovery</h3>\n<p>A crucial part of this stage has been learning that what I do does not define who I am. That’s a tired joke where I live. The joke goes that you can go to any bar, and participate in the same script: what’s your name? What do you do? “I’m Christie, and I’m a partner and the business manager at a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” is a story, and it immediately sparks self-doubt. That isn’t an answer that describes an evidence-based reality, it is an answer that describes a story, and stories by definition require effort to be believed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who I am, I am learning, is the collection of my experiences, which then drive my priorities in how I do what I do, which is business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In that podcast interview, I wasn’t told “there aren’t many business managers in the space.” I was told that there weren’t a lot of people with my background in the space. It’s the collection of my stories &#8211; of immigration, difficult childhoods, arguments in business school classrooms and accidentally viral WordPress websites, that perfectly positioned me to do what I’m doing right now.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to write for HeroPress when Topher offered was to take these thoughts out of my story. The more I grow into this role, the more I’m learning that this is especially common with people like me.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted more and more every day seeking to discover why we don’t become entrepreneurs who fearlessly pursue happiness and high-risk, high-reward situations (the common trope being that privilege is being told to strive to be anything one wants to be, while others are told to strive for an escape from instability).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of it boils down to the idea that many minorities, women, immigrants, people from low-income households &#8211; take your pick &#8211; have convinced themselves of a story that does not, in fact, reflect the reality of their possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, because there’s almost as much research that demonstrates that businesses with diverse leadership teams outperform homogeneous teams almost every single time.</p>\n<p>Let’s start talking about this, even if this isn’t something that directly relates to you. Because, if that is the case, chances are that this is a topic that relates to someone you know. Diversity of thought is an important part of our WordPress community narrative. If you are not the person who must assess replacing a story with an evidence-based reality, you may be someone who is positioned to engage in powerful actions to promote diversity of thought, like encouraging someone else to challenge the stories they tell themselves and the stories they tell others about themselves. “I’m Christie, and I lead all of the business development and marketing for a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” sounds a lot better.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20I%20Do%20Does%20Not%20Define%20Who%20I%20Am&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F&title=What+I+Do+Does+Not+Define+Who+I+Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-150x150.jpg&description=What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/" title="What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/">What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:00:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Christie Chirinos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.2 Patches Eight Security Vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74914";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-2-patches-eight-security-vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:840:"<p>WordPress 4.8.2 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/">is available for download</a> and users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

Version 3.2 is on track to make the process of updating stores a smoother experience with a long-awaited new feature that displays version compatibility checks to users prior to updating their extensions.</p>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to version 3.0 due to incompatibilities with extensions that were not fully compatible. The widespread problems with updating caused a direct hit to the plugin&#8217;s reputation, even though the main issue was with third-party extensions not being ready to go for 3.0. WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s new pre-update extension version checks will help users to be more informed about the status of extension compatibility before updating.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plugin developers can now add two new headers to their extensions to specify a minimum required version and a &#8220;tested up to&#8221; version.<br />\n<code><br />\n/*<br />\n * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Barter Gateway<br />\n * Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-barter/<br />\n * Description: Take payments by bartering crops and livestock.<br />\n * Author: WooCommerce<br />\n * Author URI: https://woocommerce.com/<br />\n * Version: 3.0.7<br />\n * Text Domain: woocommerce-gateway-barter<br />\n * Domain Path: /languages<br />\n * WC requires at least: 3.0.0<br />\n * WC tested up to: 3.2.0<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are recommended to update these headers after each major and minor WooCommerce release. (Patch releases do not require headers to be updated.)</p>\n<p>The core WooCommerce plugin will check through the extension headers and display a warning to users when updates are available, detailing which plugins have or haven&#8217;t been tested with the latest major version.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pre-update-extension-version-checks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean cited several important benefits for extension developers in a <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to field fewer complaints from users that the new WooCommerce version broke your plugin. They will have clear warnings about the dangers of upgrading when the plugin is incompatible. This should reduce your support load when new versions of WooCommerce are released.</li>\n<li>You will not have to rush updates to your plugin. If a user upgrades WooCommerce and your plugin breaks you are under a lot of pressure to release an update fast. If the user waits until a compatible version of the plugin is released before updating WooCommerce you do not have this problem.</li>\n<li>Users will trust your plugin more. By adding the header you are letting the user know that the plugin has been tested, works with their version of WooCommerce, and is actively maintained to be compatible with WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pre-update version checks for extensions is an exciting improvement for store owners and the greater WooCommerce developer community. Updates will be much easier when users can see at a glance which of their extensions are ready to go. Developers are also <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/#comment-3635" target="_blank">interested in seeing this feature applied for themes</a> and the WooCommerce team confirmed they will look into the possibility.</p>\n<p><a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/important-update-woocommerce-3-2-will-now-be-released-october-11th/" target="_blank">WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s release date</a> has been pushed back one week to October 11 to give store owners and extension developers enough time to test.

As Vue is once again among the leading contenders, I reached out to Vue.js creator Evan You to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress adopting the framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a conversation with the WordPress team mostly answering questions they had about Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The discussion happened before Matt&#8217;s announcement of moving away from React. It was mostly intended for filling the team in with the state of Vue and there was no particular conclusion made from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I got the feeling that the team had already decided to go with React and simply wanted to explore other options before they make the final call. I was a bit surprised by Matt&#8217;s post, but also understand the concerns behind that decision. I think React is a technically sound choice, and the whole patent issue is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vue is back in the mix alongside Preact.js and other libraries WordPress core contributors are considering adopting. You has been active in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642" target="_blank">comments</a> on the WordPress core development blog during the previous discussion, as well as more recently in the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733#issuecomment-330124938" target="_blank">discussion</a> in Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, clarifying misconceptions about the financial stability of the project.</p>\n<p>You has been careful to disclose his bias when participating in conversations about which framework WordPress should adopt. During my interview with him, he offered the community three reasons why he sees Vue as a good fit for the project:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that WP has decided to pick a different framework, as the creator of Vue, I surely hope that the WordPress team can adopt Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Below is why I believe Vue would be a good fit for the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;As an independent open source project (not born from within a major corporate), Vue provides a good alignment in terms of OSS values with the WordPress project. It&#8217;s fully MIT licensed, and its development is sustained by open financial contribution channels (via Patreon and OpenCollective). This means WordPress can easily ensure Vue&#8217;s sustainability by becoming a major sponsor.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Vue is one of the most approachable frameworks out there, with an established and active community, and ever-growing amount of learning resources. Adopting Vue would provide a low entry barrier and smooth learning curve for devs just getting into WordPress development. This also aligns with what made WordPress successful.</li>\n<li>&#8220;As an incrementally adoptable framework, Vue&#8217;s flexibility means it can be adapted in different use cases ranging from embedded widgets, plugin development to full single-page applications. It can be used without any compilation step in simple use cases, while being mature and powerful enough for more complex use cases such as Calypso and Gutenberg. It offers the complete stack from vdom + ability to use raw render functions, server-side rendering, routing, state management, build tooling, browser devtool extensions, to editor tooling support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evan You and six others from the Vue.js core team will be participating in an <a href="https://hashnode.com/ama/with-vuejs-team-cj7itlrki03ae62wuv2r2005s" target="_blank">AMA on Hashnode at 12PM on September 20</a>, inviting general questions about the project, how to use it and contribute, and general programming advice. The questions are already rolling in and their answers should provide more information about the future of Vue and its place in the wider JavaScript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern has also reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit" target="_blank">Jason Miller</a>, creator of Preact.js to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress selecting Preact and what it would mean for both projects. The React-alternative is another strong contender among JS libraries WordPress is looking at for use in core.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been working to ensure that WordPress developers will be able to create &#8220;Gutenblocks&#8221; using any JS library they prefer with different explorations of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a>. Ultimately, this would make creating plugins and themes less dependent on the library that is chosen for use in core. Other community members involved in the discussion, however, are keen to emphasize that the framework selected will have an impact on the greater WordPress product ecosystem, far beyond its use in Gutenberg, and are not eager to down play it as a simple technical decision. We&#8217;ll have a more detailed look on that in a separate post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the discussions on independent blogs, the Gutenberg GitHub issues queue and the #core-js channel on WordPress Slack are both hosting active conversations on the upcoming decision. This week&#8217;s core JavaScript chat has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/18/javascript-chat-canceled-for-september-19/" target="_blank">cancelled</a> due to many of those involved traveling or unable to attend. The agenda for the next meeting is to discuss the role a JavaScript framework will play in current and future core focuses (including but not limited to the Gutenberg editor). This meeting is scheduled for <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170926T1300" target="_blank">Tuesday, September 26, 2017, 8:00 AM CDT</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 17:42:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:11:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"HeroPress: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://heropress.com/?p=2113";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:131:"https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4050:"<img width="800" height="533" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301.png" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Image of a plane wing with the sunset on the horizon" /><p>One of the first addons for HeroPress I ever thought of was sending people to WordCamp who might have a hard time getting there. HeroPress started out to be a voice for people on the fringe of WordPress, and being outside the ability to go to WordCamp practically defines the fringe.</p>\n<p>I never could figure out the logistics of how to make it work. How is money handled? International law? So the idea languished.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the world, <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/getting-a-life/">Ines van Essen</a> had the same idea. She&#8217;s far more clever than I though, and she&#8217;s making it happen. She&#8217;s starting a new organization called DonateWC, specifically to help people get to WordCamp.  Not just local WordCamps, but the large ones like WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. Trips that can cost multiple months, or even a years salary.</p>\n<p>I am so so so excited that this is happening, Ines is my hero.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n<p>To get things really rolling Ines needs some funds.  I mentioned logistics earlier; if this isn&#8217;t handled properly a tax agent somewhere is going to come investigating. A non-profit org needs to be created, a logo needs to be created, a site needs to be built, a board needs to be formed, etc. Getting started costs money.</p>\n<p>So <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/startup-cost-for-donatewc">there&#8217;s a GoFundMe page for DonateWC</a>. All things considered she&#8217;s not looking for very much money right now, we can DO THIS.</p>\n<p>If we can make this thing work it&#8217;s going to really change lives. Please help out if you can, and keep an eye on the project. The first person to get sent to WordCamp is going to make history.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=DonateWC%3A%20Getting%20People%20to%20WordCamp&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F&title=DonateWC%3A+Getting+People+to+WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301-150x150.png&description=DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/" title="DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/">DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 20:42:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Vue Project Launches Community Campaign on OpenCollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74756";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://wptavern.com/vue-project-launches-community-campaign-on-opencollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4392:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-15-at-2.13.34-PM-e1505502876371.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the recent news that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" target="_blank">WordPress is abandoning React</a> due to its BSD + Patents license, core contributors are now revisiting the discussion of the merits of other frameworks. Gutenberg development is currently on hold until a new library is chosen to replace React, and selection is likely to be imminent to prevent further delay.</p>\n<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is once again a strong contender with a recent surge in enthusiastic support in <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733" target="_blank">discussions on GitHub</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624213760974165/" target="_blank">social</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624383604290514/" target="_blank">media</a> posts. One of the chief concerns WordPress core contributors had regarding Vue in previous discussions was the longevity of the project and its dependence on creator <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">Evan You</a>, who has historically done most of the development.</p>\n<p>The Vue project has recently been taking steps to mitigate this drawback. Earlier this week You announced that <a href="https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b" target="_blank">Vue is now accepting financial support on OpenCollective</a>, a platform for funding open source projects in a transparent way. You already has a successful <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a> where contributors are paying $8,815 per month to support his work on Vue, but the new <a href="https://opencollective.com/vuejs" target="_blank">OpenCollective account</a> will support the work of core contributors and community events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just four days after launching, Vue already has an estimated annual budget of $9,895 on its OpenCollective account. You is still independently accepting contributions on Patreon to fund his full-time work on the project.</p>\n<p><a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a>, the other leading contender WordPress core contributors are considering, has had an <a href="https://opencollective.com/preact" target="_blank">account on OpenCollective</a> since late 2016. Backers and sponsors have contributed to a $16,091 estimated annual budget for the project.</p>\n<p>Both Vue and Preact have growing networks of financial supporters and are not heavily influenced by a single corporation&#8217;s interests. WordPress core contributors continue to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two frameworks on various places around the web, but the discussion is somewhat scattered and it&#8217;s difficult for participants to know where their feedback will receive consideration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main options are actually all pretty good, and we&#8217;d probably be fine going with any of them, which is makes it a tough decision — objectively and technically there isn&#8217;t one clear without-a-doubt winner,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said today in WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel.</p>\n<p>An updated post detailing the frameworks and technical considerations that contributors are now examining has yet to be published to the make/wordpress.org development blog. Having communication throughout the process of selecting the framework, instead of announcing it after the decision, would go a long way towards keeping the community informed and involved. We&#8217;ll be following the public discussion as it develops.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:54:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"WPTavern: WordPress Abandons React due to Patents Clause, Gutenberg to be Rewritten with a Different Library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74834";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7411:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrinkled-paper.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/6XVYR9HYNT">	Lalesh Aldarwish</a>\n<p>This evening Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announced</a> on his blog that WordPress has decided to move away from React due to its BSD + Patents clause licensing. Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" target="_blank">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue" target="_blank">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href="https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" /> (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Gutenberg, not Calypso.

Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732" target="_blank">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: On React and WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3758:"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>. In their words, removing the patent clause would "increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits."</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m not judging Facebook or saying they&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s not my place. They have decided it&#x27;s right for them — it&#x27;s their work and they can decide to license it however they wish. I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/">Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#x27;t be published, and instead I&#x27;m here to say that <strong>the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library</strong>. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p>\n<p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the <em>long-term consistency</em> with core is worth more than a <em>short-term hit</em> to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I think Facebook’s clause is actually clearer than many other approaches companies could take, and Facebook has been one of the better open source contributors out there. But we have a lot of problems to tackle, and convincing the world that Facebook’s patent clause is fine isn’t ours to take on. It’s their fight. </p>\n<p>The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision. We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#x27;re always listening.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:59:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WPTavern: First WordCamp Dublin Set for October 14-15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74595";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"https://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dublin-set-for-october-14-15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4577:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dublin.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/sightseeing/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/dublin-city/">Ireland.com</a>\n<p>Following up on the success of WordCamp Belfast last October, the WordPress community in <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">Dublin will be hosting its first WordCamp October 14-15</a>. Both camps <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017" target="_blank">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href="http://business.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/" target="_blank">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin" target="_blank">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3269:"<p>GitHub <a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

This has been a frequent <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-painfully-slow/36298" target="_blank">topic</a> of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989606" target="_blank">discussion</a> for several years and its creators admit that <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-feels-slow-or-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-or-memory/32662?source_topic_id=36298" target="_blank">performance isn&#8217;t one of its strongest features</a>. However, sometimes extreme performance issues can be caused by a package that a user has installed.</p>\n<p>Atom partnered with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://nuclide.io/" target="_blank">Nuclide</a> project developers to develop the new <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui" target="_blank">Atom IDE UI</a> package that uses Atom’s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient" target="_blank">atom-languageclient</a> library in displaying features supported by the <a href="http://langserver.org/" target="_blank">language server protocol</a>. Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-php" target="_blank">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6033:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/" target="_blank">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code. SEO consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-law-9444b637/" target="_blank">David Law</a> was the first to bring this issue to the attention of the plugin team after discovering that Display Widgets was inserting content into sites from external servers and also collecting visitor data without permission. He posted to the WordPress.org forums <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-1-deleted-from-the-plugin-repository/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-3-1-includes-hacking-code/" target="_blank">times</a> to warn other users.</p>\n<p>Wordfence has been warning its customers about the plugin during the past several months and published a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/display-widgets-malware/" target="_blank">timeline</a> tracking how Display Widgets was removed from WordPress.org on four separate occasions. According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/" target="_blank">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/" target="_blank">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption. The second owner has effectively destroyed any trust a person might have in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: You CANNOT visit the page or download it as a new plugin for a reason. This plugin is done. It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites. Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/" target="_blank">widget visibility module</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank">Widget Options</a> by Phpbits Creative Studio, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-sidebars/" target="_blank">Custom Sidebars</a> by WPMU Dev, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-aware-sidebars/" target="_blank">Content Aware Sidebars</a> are a few popular alternatives on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The plugin team does not currently disclose why certain plugins have been closed or removed from WordPress.org, but they are working on providing better communication for users. One meta trac <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627" target="_blank">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860" target="_blank">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine." /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life. If only I could be normal, then everything would be alright. There was not a lot wrong in my life when I was a kid, growing up in a small dutch town. I had a normal family with 2 parents (a mum and a dad) and a younger sister. My life was pretty normal. The problem was: It didn’t feel normal; I didn’t feel normal. You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/" title="Making My Own Normal"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1424:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0" target="_blank">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/" target="_blank">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616" target="_blank">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason" target="_blank">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620" target="_blank">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href="https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/" target="_blank">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693" target="_blank">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks" target="_blank">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>. Gutenberg&#8217;s one-dimensional, vertically stacking approach to designing pages isn&#8217;t very inspiring. This may frustrate average users whose expectations have not been tempered with the understanding that a future version will include an expanded page building experience. A plugin that allows users to opt out until it is an improvement over their current tools is going to be crucial for keeping the community happy.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 04:22:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WPTavern: “The Final Word” Plugin Extends O2 to Pin a Highlighted Comment to the Top of a Thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/the-final-word-plugin-extends-o2-to-pin-a-highlighted-comment-to-the-top-of-a-thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3311:"<p>&#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/" target="_blank">The Final Word</a>&#8221; is a new plugin that extends O2 to highlight a comment at the top of a thread. <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">O2</a> is the plugin successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, Automattic&#8217;s group blogging theme that introduced quick posting from the front page with real-time comment updates.

Hugh Lashbrooke <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/08/24/o2-plugin-request-the-final-word/" target="_blank">created The Final Word for use on the WordPress Community Team blog</a> so that long discussion threads could be summed up in a single comment. He likened the new feature as something similar to the &#8220;accepted answer&#8221; function on Stack Exchange or other support forums where the best answer floats to the top. Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community" target="_blank">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well.

The exposed data includes names, birth dates, social security numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, driver&#8217;s license numbers, and other sensitive financial information.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/" target="_blank">equifaxsecurity2017.com</a> site was launched shortly after disclosure to give consumers information about the security incident. Equifax reports that the company has found no evidence of unauthorized activity on its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases but is offering free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring services to U.S. consumers who enter their last names and last six digits of their social security number into its form.</p>\n<p>Consumers are rightfully wary of the website, as the company is asking for more personal information in order to sign people up for another one of its products.

A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API. Edelman PR opted to use a free Cloudflare certificate to secure the site.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only did <a href="https://twitter.com/Equifax">@Equifax</a> suffer a massive data breach, but their site about the breach is using a free shared CloudFlare SSL cert. ಠ_ಠ <a href="https://t.co/r4bvPpde1i">pic.twitter.com/r4bvPpde1i</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Lo Nigro (@Daniel15) <a href="https://twitter.com/Daniel15/status/905953979934187520">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consumers were also off put by the verbiage of the arbitration clause included in the terms and services of the free credit monitoring, which appears to force those who sign up to waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits against the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot recall a previous data breach in which the breached company’s public outreach and response has been so haphazard and ill-conceived,&#8221; Krebs said.</p>\n<p>Kenneth White, a security researcher and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project, said on Twitter that he was amazed the site was running stock WordPress but that his comments specifically referenced the sloppy implementation of the site.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">intent wasn''t to blast WP, this is just sloppy—default admin pages, default nginx errors, wonky certs, phish flagged…</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kenn White (@kennwhite) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennwhite/status/906152286908551168">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Due to how the site was set up, it appeared to many consumers and researchers as Equifax&#8217;s way of stalling or perhaps even scamming those who may have been affected by the breach. Various browsers flagged it as a phishing threat, and some consumers found they were given different answers from the form based on whether they checked with desktop or mobile devices. In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2000:"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

Matías Ventura published two video examples to demonstrate where they see Gutenberg headed on its journey towards becoming a full-fledged website building tool. Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks. The second one shows how a theme might include templates with blocks already in place that provide users with a guided page-building experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These examples clarify some of the benefits the team is aiming for with Gutenberg and how WordPress theme authors will be able to build more user-friendly experiences on top of the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are quickly put together, but I hope it shows how things can progress even with very straightforward theme integration,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;As soon as we expand the scope and include more blocks (site title, site header, menus, more widgets, etc), and describe a way to store page templates as a «list of blocks», Gutenberg would be fundamentally capable of building an entire website.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 20:02:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 287 – WordPress Meetups, Events, and WordCamps with Andrea Middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74614&preview=true&preview_id=74614";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-287-wordpress-meetups-events-and-wordcamps-with-andrea-middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1776:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://andreamiddleton.blog/">Andrea Middleton</a>, Dot org Wrangler at Automattic.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/" title="Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Damian Samolej";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2636:"<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/" target="_blank">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106" target="_blank">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629" target="_blank">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>. This interfered with XML-RPC requests and some users reported issues managing their sites from WordPress.com and connecting to third-party apps. Downgrading to PHP 7.0 or disabling opcache in PHP 7.1 provided temporary workarounds for many users but this is no longer required as of Jetpack 5.3.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-5-expands-monetization-with-wordads-integration" target="_blank">Jetpack added integration with WordAds</a>, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2688:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6420:"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8631:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href="http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/mysweetcate" target="_blank">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4yrs ago I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3151:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week. Design lead Tammie Lister said the team decided &#8220;not let numbers set expectations&#8221; and will carry on at the same pace with weekly releases.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible UI updates in version 1.0 is the new ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2447" target="_blank">add image blocks by dragging and dropping them into the editor</a>. They can be placed directly within the content (between blocks) and also onto the image block placeholder. Gutenberg includes a blue line indicator for dropzones where users can place an image.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After testing I found this feature works smoothly but is a little slow. The slight delay of uploading the image after placing it may leave the user confused about what is happening. However, feedback on this particular pull request indicates that the team is working on displaying an immediate reaction to the image having been dropped, instead of waiting for the upload to finish.</p>\n<p>This release also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2452" target="_blank">merges the paragraph and cover text blocks</a>. Contributors agreed that the two blocks could be easily combined and the colors and font size options from the previous cover block have now been added to the block settings sidebar.</p>\n<p>A few other improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked color palette picker with a “clear” and a “custom color” option</li>\n<li>Further improvements to inline pasting and fixing errant empty blocks</li>\n<li>Added thumbnail size selector to image blocks</li>\n<li>Added support for url input and align and edit buttons to audio block</li>\n<li>Restored keyboard navigation with more robust implementation, addressing previous browser issues</li>\n<li>Added align and edit buttons to video block</li>\n<li>Show “add new term” in hierarchical taxonomies (including categories)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the experience of writing within Gutenberg is improving, and the 1.0 release announcement includes an animated gif to demonstrate a user typing in the paragraph block:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/typing.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor is getting better at staying out of the way when a user is writing, but the slightest mouse move within the paragraph block will slide all of the block&#8217;s surrounding controls into view. This experience can be a bit jarring, but it may be inevitable unless more of the UI can be buried under the inspector. The paragraph blocks currently display the most commonly used controls for writing text content, but I could see plugins hooking into this to create different types of writing experiences that either add more controls or pare it back to something more minimalist.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:42:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Now Allows Plugin Authors to Specify a Minimum PHP Version Requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74438";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-allows-plugin-authors-to-specify-a-minimum-php-version-requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2585:"<p>Although WordPress core currently maintains backwards compatibility with PHP 5.2.4+, plugin and theme authors are not required to do so. When developers include features that require more recent versions of PHP, it can break sites or cause otherwise unexpected behavior. As part of a larger effort to encourage users to upgrade their PHP versions, WordPress.org now allows plugin authors to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/" target="_blank">specify a minimum PHP version requirement</a> in the <code>readme.txt</code> file with a new Requires PHP header. It is displayed to users in the sidebar of the plugin&#8217;s description:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/requires-php-version.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This addition to the readme.txt file has been well-received by developers who are already updating their plugins in the directory with minimum PHP version requirements. It also complements WordPress’ Core PHP team&#8217;s recent efforts to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-to-add-new-page-educating-users-on-benefits-of-upgrading-php" target="_blank">educate users about the benefits of upgrading PHP</a>, as the minimum supported version was released 10 years ago and hasn&#8217;t received security patches for nearly seven years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin developer (who maintains my plugins in my spare time), it is becoming increasingly difficult to build new functionality that works in older versions of PHP,&#8221; Paul Gilzow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/#comment-43314" target="_blank">commented</a> on the announcement. &#8220;There are some things that simply cannot be done in the older versions, and in those cases, I have to build out functionality to check PHP versions and disable those features. That takes time and energy away from building out other new features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Sergey Biryukov said the next step is exploring the possibility of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934" target="_blank">displaying a notice to users when they cannot install a theme or plugin</a> due to their installations not meeting the required criteria. Ideally, these notices would include host-specific instructions to assist users in getting their sites upgraded to a newer PHP version. This particular move could make a significant impact on the wider WordPress community, if popular plugins start triggering notices requiring newer versions of PHP.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:13:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sun, 01 Oct 2017 15:11:09 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sun, 01 Oct 2017 15:00:12 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20170922110811";}', 'no');

(62, 1, '2017-08-11 09:47:52', '2017-08-11 09:47:52', '<h1>Why has this science of Homeopathy survived for more than 250 years? Here are 50 obvious reasons:</h1>\r\n[embed]https://youtu.be/UrkZs3P-cc8[/embed]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHomeopathy was discovered by a German scientist named Dr. Samuel Hahnemann accidentally in 1796. Ever since the science has only grown. Although the ups and downs the science of Homeopathy has survived for more than 250 years!\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Hippocrates</strong> ''The Father of Medicine'' of Ancient Greece said there were two Laws of Healing: The Law of Opposites and the Law of Similars. Homeopathy treats the patient with medicines using the Law of Similars, orthodox (Allopathy) medicine uses the Law of Opposites, e.g. anti-pyretic (against fever) antibiotics (against life), anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-emetics and everything else thats anti (opposite) to the symptom.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is based on fixed principles of the <strong>Laws of Nature</strong> which do not change unlike medical theories which are constantly changing! Yes these are LAWS and not theories! Why else would you have 5 generations of antibiotics to kill the otherwise harmless bacteria? and the same generation of homeopathic drugs like Sulphur, Nux Vomica, Pulsatilla, etc ever since they were discovered some 250 years ago?</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is an <strong>evidence-based</strong> system of medicine, empirical medicine. Here drug proving is done systematically on Healthy human beings and NOT on lower animals as all drugs are tissue protein specific. Drugs proven on lower animals will never show the same effect on Humans as the tissue proteins are different in each species. They are species specific as well.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is both an <strong>art and a science</strong>. With growing technology the scientific part gets simpler everyday and the art part minimises. Homeopathy is becoming more and more mathematical everyday with the use of software technology and expert systems like the famous KES: Khedekar Expert System.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathic <strong><i>provings</i></strong> of medicines are a more scientific method of testing than the orthodox (allopathy) model. Here drugs are proved on Healthy Humans and symptoms are recorded from the Mind first and then physically from Head to toe. Also newer medicines are being proved every day and they add to the Materia Medica and Repertory.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicine awakens and stimulates the body''s own curative powers. The potentized remedy acts as a catalyst to set healing into motion. This is also called as self healing through the body''s own <strong>DNA repair mechanism</strong>. With homeopathy doctors make the patients'' own body repair or heal it self. Hence the spectrum of diseases curable with Homeopathy is much bigger than with conventional systems.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines work by communicating a vibration/pattern/frequency of energy via the whole human body to jump start the body''s own inherent <strong>healing</strong> mechanisms.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy assists the body to heal itself, to overcome an illness which brings the patient to a <strong><i>higher</i></strong> level of health. Orthodox medicine suppresses the illness, bringing the patient to a lower level of health.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathy practitioner endeavours to search for and treat the <strong><i>cause</i></strong> of the disease in order to heal the <i>effect</i>.</li>\r\n 	<li>Outcomes of homeopathic treatment are measured by the <i>long term</i> <strong>curative</strong> effects of prescribing and complete eradication of the disease state in the deviated human.</li>\r\n 	<li>The homeopathic practitioner treats the <strong><i>whole person</i></strong>, because man doesn''t exist in parts. All his trillions of cells have actually evolved from one single embryo in the mother''s womb. All cells share the same genetic information (code). Hence all symptoms are interrelated and seeks to select a medicine which most closely covers them all in symptom similarity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic remedies are <strong>cheapest</strong>. For example, in India 35 people can be cured in INR. 50/-</li>\r\n 	<li>Pharmaceutical preparations (allopathic drugs) are very expensive.</li>\r\n 	<li>There are more than 4,000 homeopathic homeopathy medicines that can be used in millions of disease conditions based on symptom similarity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines have <strong>no toxic side-effects</strong>. This is due to the high dilution (potentization) and infrequent repetition as used in ''Classical Homeopathy''.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines are <strong><i>non-addictive</i></strong>. And hence no drug dependency will ever happen.</li>\r\n 	<li>Every true homeopathic medicine is made using <i>one substance <strong>(law of Simplex)</strong>,</i> whether plant, mineral, metal, animal, etc. The exact substance is known, unlike most modern drugs where we are rarely informed of the ingredients and their effects. Like the use of mercurial compounds to increase the shelf-life of Vaccines</li>\r\n 	<li>Any remedy up to a 12c or a 24x potency still contains the original molecules of the substance and this is according to <strong>Avogadro''s number</strong>.</li>\r\n 	<li>No two people on this earth''s population of about 8billion are the same. Every Patient is Unique so homeopathic medicines are <strong>individualized</strong> to treat the man in ideas and not the disease in man. e.g: two people suffering from the same viral flu will get two different medicines because killing the virus won''t be the solution but stimulating individual immunity is the solution.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopaths treat genetic illness or <strong>traits </strong>one is born with, tracing its origins to 3 main genetic causes: tendency for Functional disturbance (Psora), tendency for Structural disturbance (sycosis) and tendency for destructive disturbance (syphilis).</li>\r\n 	<li>Epidemics such as cholera and typhoid were treated successfully using Homeopathy (<strong>genus epidemicus</strong>) in the 19th century with very high success rates, compared to orthodox medicine <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/winston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.whale.to/v/winston.html</a></li>\r\n 	<li>There are thousands of homeopathic books, available at specialist outlets, not sold in the high street.</li>\r\n 	<li>There are 5 homeopathic <strong>hospitals</strong> in the U.K. In London, Tunbridge Wells, Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow. They cost the NHS under £10 million a year compared to the £100 billion for the total annual NHS budget for 2008! There are hundreds of Homeopathy hospitals in India and in Germany. The avg health care expenditure of Germans is lower than Americans. Also the life expectancy of Germans is higher than that of Americans.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2459" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sick-around-the-world-19-728-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>\r\n 	<li>At one of the earliest debates on the NHS Act of 1948 the Government pledged that homoeopathy would continue to be available on the NHS, as long as there were "patients wishing to receive it and doctors willing to provide it".</li>\r\n 	<li>There is a campaign by certain U.K. Professors to oust homeopathy completely from the <strong>NHS</strong> after they wrote on NHS headed paper to all Primary Care Trusts in 2006 telling managers not to refer patients to the homeopathic hospitals. This was due to the huge pressure from pharma cartels.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathic Hospitals are clean, with friendly, well informed staff. The patients are generally pleased with their treatment unlike many orthodox National Health Service hospitals.</li>\r\n 	<li>The chances of contracting MRSA or C. Difficile at a Homeopathic Hospital are extremely rare.</li>\r\n 	<li>Unlike orthodox medicine (allopathy) where two thirds of all conventional hospital admissions are due to the side-effects of pharmaceutical medicines, the bill for negligence claims soaring into billions, one U.K. leading insurance company reported only ''a couple'' of claims against homeopaths in a ten year period!</li>\r\n 	<li>In the United States in the early 1900s there were 22 homeopathic medical schools and over 100 homeopathic hospitals, 60 orphanages and old people''s homes and 1,000+ homeopathic pharmacies. These figures came down after 1970 after the death of the stalwart homeopath J. T. Kent. And after change in regulations in certain states due to the huge pressure of the pharma lobby.</li>\r\n 	<li>Members of the <strong>American Medical Association</strong> had great animosity towards homeopathy after its formation in 1847 and it was decided to purge all local medical societies of physicians who were homeopaths.</li>\r\n 	<li>Big Pharma mafia does not want the Public to find out how well homeopathy works! This will otherwise have a direct effect on their sales.</li>\r\n 	<li>In 2005 the World Health Organisation (<strong>WHO</strong>) brought out a draft report which showed homeopathy was beneficial causing Big Pharma to panic and <i>The Lancet</i> to bring out an editorial entitled ''The End of Homeopathy''.</li>\r\n 	<li>In 2005 <strong><i>The Lancet</i></strong> tried to destroy homeopathy but were only looking at 8 inconclusive trials out of 110 of which 102 were positive. This was a fraudulent analysis.\r\n"The meta-analysis at the centre of the controversy is based on 110 placebo-controlled clinical trials of homeopathy and 110 clinical trials of allopathy (conventional medicine), which are said to be matched. These were reduced to 21 trials of homeopathy and 9 of conventional medicine of ''higher quality'' and further reduced to 8 and 6 trials, respectively, which were ''larger, higher quality''. The final analysis which concluded that ''the clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects'' was based on just the eight ''larger, higher quality'' clinical trials of homeopathy. The Lancet''s press release did not mention this, instead giving the impression that the conclusions were based on all 110 trials."\r\n<a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1375230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerend</a></li>\r\n 	<li>There have been many <strong>clinical trials</strong> that prove homeopathy works. In the past 24 years there have been more than 180 controlled, and 118 randomized, trials into homeopathy, which were analysed by four separate meta-analyses. In each case, the researchers concluded that the benefits of homeopathy went far beyond that which could be explained purely by the placebo effect.</li>\r\n 	<li>The <strong>Bristol Homeopathic Hospital</strong> carried out a study published in November 2005 of 6500 patients receiving homeopathic treatment. There was an overall improvement in health of 70% of them. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4454856.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4</a></li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy can never be properly tested through double blind randomised trials because each prescription is individualised as every patient is unique. Therefore 10 people with arthritis, for example, may all need 10 different homeopathic medicines.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines are not tested on animals or lower animals. They are only tested on <strong>humans</strong>.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines work even better on animals and babies than on adults, proving this cannot be placebo. My research on Developmental disorders in pediatric cases is self explanatory. <a href="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ResearchPaper.pdf">Research on Developmental Disorders in Pediatric cases</a></li>\r\n 	<li>Scientists agree that if and when homeopathy is accepted by the scientific community it will turn established science on its head. This creates panic in the pharma industry.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic Practitioners train for 5 1/2 years in Anatomy and Physiology, as well as Pathology and Disease, Surgery, Medicine, Materia Medica, Homeopathic Philosophy and study of the Homeopathic Repertory to get their Bachelor''s degree and a minimum of 3 more years to get their Masters in India. <strong>BHMS</strong>: Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery and MD: Doctor of Medicine respectively. There are more than 200 homeopathy colleges in India alone. Homeopaths in India are on par with their allopathy counterparts.</li>\r\n 	<li>Most homeopaths treat patients who have been referred to them by word of mouth. Most patients seek out homeopathy because conventional treatment has not benefited them or because it poses too great a risk of side-effects.</li>\r\n 	<li>The homeopathic community has thousands, even millions, of written case notes that demonstrate the positive benefits of their treatment. Many homeopaths like me have video proof of their patients before and after treatment.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopaths in UK charge patients an average of £50 an hour. Specialist Doctors can charge up to £200 or more. In India Homeopaths charge anything bet <strong>$1</strong> till $200 for a single consultation which includes medicines as well. <a href="http://www.imperialclinics.com">http://www.imperialclinics.com</a> (fees section)</li>\r\n 	<li>The popularity of homeopathy has grown in the past 30 years, its revival entirely through word of mouth and estimated to be growing at more than <strong>20%</strong> a year the world over.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2460" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2460" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-03-at-5.02.01-PM-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /> Homeopathy treatment market[/caption]</li>\r\n 	<li>Thousands of famous people throughout the past 250 years have enjoyed the benefits of homeopathic medicine.

Here are 50 obvious reasons:</h1>\r\n[embed]https://youtu.be/UrkZs3P-cc8[/embed]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHomeopathy was discovered by a German scientist named Dr. Samuel Hahnemann accidentally in 1796. Ever since the science has only grown. Although the ups and downs the science of Homeopathy has survived for more than 250 years!\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Hippocrates</strong> ''The Father of Medicine'' of Ancient Greece said there were two Laws of Healing: The Law of Opposites and the Law of Similars. Homeopathy treats the patient with medicines using the Law of Similars, orthodox (Allopathy) medicine uses the Law of Opposites, e.g. anti-pyretic (against fever) antibiotics (against life), anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-emetics and everything else thats anti (opposite) to the symptom.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is based on fixed principles of the <strong>Laws of Nature</strong> which do not change unlike medical theories which are constantly changing! Yes these are LAWS and not theories! Why else would you have 5 generations of antibiotics to kill the otherwise harmless bacteria? and the same generation of homeopathic drugs like Sulphur, Nux Vomica, Pulsatilla, etc ever since they were discovered some 250 years ago?</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is an <strong>evidence-based</strong> system of medicine, empirical medicine. Here drug proving is done systematically on Healthy human beings and NOT on lower animals as all drugs are tissue protein specific. Drugs proven on lower animals will never show the same effect on Humans as the tissue proteins are different in each species. They are species specific as well.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy is both an <strong>art and a science</strong>. With growing technology the scientific part gets simpler everyday and the art part minimises. Homeopathy is becoming more and more mathematical everyday with the use of software technology and expert systems like the famous KES: Khedekar Expert System.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathic <strong><i>provings</i></strong> of medicines are a more scientific method of testing than the orthodox (allopathy) model. Here drugs are proved on Healthy Humans and symptoms are recorded from the Mind first and then physically from Head to toe. Also newer medicines are being proved every day and they add to the Materia Medica and Repertory.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicine awakens and stimulates the body''s own curative powers. The potentized remedy acts as a catalyst to set healing into motion. This is also called as self healing through the body''s own <strong>DNA repair mechanism</strong>. With homeopathy doctors make the patients'' own body repair or heal it self. Hence the spectrum of diseases curable with Homeopathy is much bigger than with conventional systems.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines work by communicating a vibration/pattern/frequency of energy via the whole human body to jump start the body''s own inherent <strong>healing</strong> mechanisms.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy assists the body to heal itself, to overcome an illness which brings the patient to a <strong><i>higher</i></strong> level of health. Orthodox medicine suppresses the illness, bringing the patient to a lower level of health.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathy practitioner endeavours to search for and treat the <strong><i>cause</i></strong> of the disease in order to heal the <i>effect</i>.</li>\r\n 	<li>Outcomes of homeopathic treatment are measured by the <i>long term</i> <strong>curative</strong> effects of prescribing and complete eradication of the disease state in the deviated human.</li>\r\n 	<li>The homeopathic practitioner treats the <strong><i>whole person</i></strong>, because man doesn''t exist in parts. All his trillions of cells have actually evolved from one single embryo in the mother''s womb. All cells share the same genetic information (code). Hence all symptoms are interrelated and seeks to select a medicine which most closely covers them all in symptom similarity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic remedies are <strong>cheapest</strong>. For example, in India 35 people can be cured in INR. 50/-</li>\r\n 	<li>Pharmaceutical preparations (allopathic drugs) are very expensive.</li>\r\n 	<li>There are more than 4,000 homeopathic homeopathy medicines that can be used in millions of disease conditions based on symptom similarity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines have <strong>no toxic side-effects</strong>. This is due to the high dilution (potentization) and infrequent repetition as used in ''Classical Homeopathy''.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines are <strong><i>non-addictive</i></strong>. And hence no drug dependency will ever happen.</li>\r\n 	<li>Every true homeopathic medicine is made using <i>one substance <strong>(law of Simplex)</strong>,</i> whether plant, mineral, metal, animal, etc. The exact substance is known, unlike most modern drugs where we are rarely informed of the ingredients and their effects. Like the use of mercurial compounds to increase the shelf-life of Vaccines</li>\r\n 	<li>Any remedy up to a 12c or a 24x potency still contains the original molecules of the substance and this is according to <strong>Avogadro''s number</strong>.</li>\r\n 	<li>No two people on this earth''s population of about 8billion are the same. Every Patient is Unique so homeopathic medicines are <strong>individualized</strong> to treat the man in ideas and not the disease in man. e.g: two people suffering from the same viral flu will get two different medicines because killing the virus won''t be the solution but stimulating individual immunity is the solution.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopaths treat genetic illness or <strong>traits </strong>one is born with, tracing its origins to 3 main genetic causes: tendency for Functional disturbance (Psora), tendency for Structural disturbance (sycosis) and tendency for destructive disturbance (syphilis).</li>\r\n 	<li>Epidemics such as cholera and typhoid were treated successfully using Homeopathy (<strong>genus epidemicus</strong>) in the 19th century with very high success rates, compared to orthodox medicine <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/winston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.whale.to/v/winston.html</a></li>\r\n 	<li>There are thousands of homeopathic books, available at specialist outlets, not sold in the high street.</li>\r\n 	<li>There are 5 homeopathic <strong>hospitals</strong> in the U.K. In London, Tunbridge Wells, Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow. They cost the NHS under £10 million a year compared to the £100 billion for the total annual NHS budget for 2008! There are hundreds of Homeopathy hospitals in India and in Germany. The avg health care expenditure of Germans is lower than Americans. Also the life expectancy of Germans is higher than that of Americans.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2459" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sick-around-the-world-19-728-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>\r\n 	<li>At one of the earliest debates on the NHS Act of 1948 the Government pledged that homoeopathy would continue to be available on the NHS, as long as there were "patients wishing to receive it and doctors willing to provide it".</li>\r\n 	<li>There is a campaign by certain U.K. Professors to oust homeopathy completely from the <strong>NHS</strong> after they wrote on NHS headed paper to all Primary Care Trusts in 2006 telling managers not to refer patients to the homeopathic hospitals. This was due to the huge pressure from pharma cartels.</li>\r\n 	<li>The Homeopathic Hospitals are clean, with friendly, well informed staff. The patients are generally pleased with their treatment unlike many orthodox National Health Service hospitals.</li>\r\n 	<li>The chances of contracting MRSA or C. Difficile at a Homeopathic Hospital are extremely rare.</li>\r\n 	<li>Unlike orthodox medicine (allopathy) where two thirds of all conventional hospital admissions are due to the side-effects of pharmaceutical medicines, the bill for negligence claims soaring into billions, one U.K. leading insurance company reported only ''a couple'' of claims against homeopaths in a ten year period!</li>\r\n 	<li>In the United States in the early 1900s there were 22 homeopathic medical schools and over 100 homeopathic hospitals, 60 orphanages and old people''s homes and 1,000+ homeopathic pharmacies. These figures came down after 1970 after the death of the stalwart homeopath J. T. Kent. And after change in regulations in certain states due to the huge pressure of the pharma lobby.</li>\r\n 	<li>Members of the <strong>American Medical Association</strong> had great animosity towards homeopathy after its formation in 1847 and it was decided to purge all local medical societies of physicians who were homeopaths.</li>\r\n 	<li>Big Pharma mafia does not want the Public to find out how well homeopathy works! This will otherwise have a direct effect on their sales.</li>\r\n 	<li>In 2005 the World Health Organisation (<strong>WHO</strong>) brought out a draft report which showed homeopathy was beneficial causing Big Pharma to panic and <i>The Lancet</i> to bring out an editorial entitled ''The End of Homeopathy''.</li>\r\n 	<li>In 2005 <strong><i>The Lancet</i></strong> tried to destroy homeopathy but were only looking at 8 inconclusive trials out of 110 of which 102 were positive. This was a fraudulent analysis.\r\n"The meta-analysis at the centre of the controversy is based on 110 placebo-controlled clinical trials of homeopathy and 110 clinical trials of allopathy (conventional medicine), which are said to be matched. These were reduced to 21 trials of homeopathy and 9 of conventional medicine of ''higher quality'' and further reduced to 8 and 6 trials, respectively, which were ''larger, higher quality''. The final analysis which concluded that ''the clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects'' was based on just the eight ''larger, higher quality'' clinical trials of homeopathy. The Lancet''s press release did not mention this, instead giving the impression that the conclusions were based on all 110 trials."\r\n<a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1375230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerend</a></li>\r\n 	<li>There have been many <strong>clinical trials</strong> that prove homeopathy works. In the past 24 years there have been more than 180 controlled, and 118 randomized, trials into homeopathy, which were analysed by four separate meta-analyses. In each case, the researchers concluded that the benefits of homeopathy went far beyond that which could be explained purely by the placebo effect.</li>\r\n 	<li>The <strong>Bristol Homeopathic Hospital</strong> carried out a study published in November 2005 of 6500 patients receiving homeopathic treatment. There was an overall improvement in health of 70% of them. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4454856.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4</a></li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathy can never be properly tested through double blind randomised trials because each prescription is individualised as every patient is unique. Therefore 10 people with arthritis, for example, may all need 10 different homeopathic medicines.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines are not tested on animals or lower animals. They are only tested on <strong>humans</strong>.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic medicines work even better on animals and babies than on adults, proving this cannot be placebo. My research on Developmental disorders in pediatric cases is self explanatory. <a href="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ResearchPaper.pdf">Research on Developmental Disorders in Pediatric cases</a></li>\r\n 	<li>Scientists agree that if and when homeopathy is accepted by the scientific community it will turn established science on its head. This creates panic in the pharma industry.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopathic Practitioners train for 5 1/2 years in Anatomy and Physiology, as well as Pathology and Disease, Surgery, Medicine, Materia Medica, Homeopathic Philosophy and study of the Homeopathic Repertory to get their Bachelor''s degree and a minimum of 3 more years to get their Masters in India. <strong>BHMS</strong>: Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery and MD: Doctor of Medicine respectively. There are more than 200 homeopathy colleges in India alone. Homeopaths in India are on par with their allopathy counterparts.</li>\r\n 	<li>Most homeopaths treat patients who have been referred to them by word of mouth. Most patients seek out homeopathy because conventional treatment has not benefited them or because it poses too great a risk of side-effects.</li>\r\n 	<li>The homeopathic community has thousands, even millions, of written case notes that demonstrate the positive benefits of their treatment. Many homeopaths like me have video proof of their patients before and after treatment.</li>\r\n 	<li>Homeopaths in UK charge patients an average of £50 an hour. Specialist Doctors can charge up to £200 or more. In India Homeopaths charge anything bet <strong>$1</strong> till $200 for a single consultation which includes medicines as well. <a href="http://www.imperialclinics.com">http://www.imperialclinics.com</a> (fees section)</li>\r\n 	<li>The popularity of homeopathy has grown in the past 30 years, its revival entirely through word of mouth and estimated to be growing at more than <strong>20%</strong> a year the world over.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2460" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2460" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-03-at-5.02.01-PM-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /> Homeopathy treatment market[/caption]</li>\r\n 	<li>Thousands of famous people throughout the past 250 years have enjoyed the benefits of homeopathic medicine.

Who would disagree, as the explanation that is currently provided to support homeopathy makes very little sense. How is it possible that a solution that contains no chemical atoms (Avogadro''s number) causes a biological reaction in the body? All of our basic understanding of science screams out that this is impossible.\r\n\r\nBut what if all that we have been taught at school, at university and at work is in fact only part of the truth. What if there was a missing part of our education that provides the missing link that makes subjects such as homeopathy scientifically obvious? What if there is much more to our body than simply chemicals?\r\n\r\nIt took me 9 years of research to uncover this hidden area of science. Once I did, the scientific explanation for many controversial areas of science, including homeopathy, became uncontroversial. What I am about to tell you about homeopathy is just one of the many areas of science that have been hidden from us which are finally exposed in my research over 15 years. Its published on my website <a href="http://www.imperialclinics.com/">www.imperialclinics.com</a> in the Developmental Disorders section.\r\n\r\nHere''s the link <a href="http://imperialclinics.com/challenge-norms">http://imperialclinics.com/challenge-norms</a>\r\n\r\nI initiated a 7 year international study (Location: India, Serbia and and Indians living in USA) of 500 children in the 3 – 15 year age group with delayed development, autism, tuberous sclerosis, dyspraxia, border line Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and cerebral palsy. The study found 60% of the developmental disorder cases had personal family problems or other issues at home. Also 30% of children who were diagnosed with a developmental disorder were pre-term, had mothers with low BMI, sub fertility, and stress during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe children were put under Homeopathic <strong>corrective bio-therapy</strong> where each child’s own growth gradient was stimulated by giving a specific homeopathy medicine aimed at the child''s constitution (mental and physical make-up). These children were regularly monitored in for 2-7 years individually and an independent Population Genetics expert also monitored each child to infer the pre and post treatment differences. 80% of the children were found to be living a physically and psychologically balanced life.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the treatment and management through homeopathy wass not to treat the isolated symptoms of the developmental disorder, but to treat the child as a whole and help in building up the personality traits of the child from the time of the treatment.\r\n\r\nIf we look at Homeopathy from a completely different area of science other than chemistry then we can begin to understand how Homeopathy really works. It is just like one of those intellectual games that people play, where the answer is so obvious once you know it, but impossible if you don''t.\r\n\r\nTake the following situation:\r\n\r\nYour body is <strong>one whole thing</strong>. Its made up of systems like respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, etc. All these systems are made up of organs like lungs, liver, heart, etc. All these organs are made up of tissues e.g: connective, muscle, nervous, etc. All these tissues are made up of specialised cells e.g: neutron, hepatocyte, epidermal, etc. Here is the most important part. All these cells have a nucleus (except for RBCs). The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell''s genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of <strong>DNA</strong>. This DNA is interesting as it stores tons of information. Yes, information on how each cell should behave! The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences. So any treatment aimed at changing tendencies of the body must correct errors here. Inherited or acquired. e.g: Hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease. All in all would you be able to change a code with any material substance?\r\n\r\nThis won''t be possible with material substances: homeopathic, allopathic, ayurvedic, etc, etc...\r\n\r\nA BIG NO!!!!\r\n\r\n<strong>You may give a child a punishment or reward to behave better but matter influences matter and information influences information. Only education can transform you through the impressions you''ve had through it, the physical books are useless!</strong>\r\n\r\nNow if we turn back to homeopathy, we have to look at it from the same idea and say that the idea that chemicals are the issue is irrelevant to solving the problem.\r\n\r\nIt is not the chemicals in the solution that cause a biological change but the vibrations that emanated from the chemicals, which have an affect. The massive missing part of our education is simply the concept of "vibrations" and everything that they affect. The same is true with every aspect of our body, it works on two levels, a chemical one and a vibrational one, they go hand in hand, one does not work without the other.\r\n\r\nAs every <strong>electron</strong> vibrates uniquely and everything is made up of electrons then it is incontrovertible to state that everything vibrates, absolutely everything. So if everything vibrates, it would seem fairly logical that one vibration must affect another. Just take sound as an example, a choir all singing together sounds very different from a school playground.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens in our body, you get choirs in parts of our body where it is healthy vibrationally and noisy playgrounds where our body''s organs are malfunctioning causing vibrational disharmony and sickness.\r\n\r\nThis idea is hugely controversial as it contradicts everything that we have been taught. The tragedy however, is that science has proven it to be true in thousands of different studies, but has not promoted is as it implies that pharmaceutical drugs are not the only cure in town. And the money is in materials... easy!\r\n\r\nSo if vibrations are the answer what about the big idea that is put forward by homeopaths that is it also to do with the concept that water has some sort of a memory to provide evidence that homeopathy works scientifically.\r\n\r\nThis is <strong>total nonsense</strong> and provides yet more ammunition to everyone who wants to dismiss a perfectly sensible area of science as pseudo-science. <strong>WATER DOES NOT HAVE A MEMORY</strong>. Of course it doesn''t. Water has amazing functions but memory is not one of them.\r\n\r\nWater has the amazing property that enables it to change its vibrational pattern to the chemical or environment in which it is in. This is an incredibly important point and one that needs to be remembered, water is a chameleon, adapting itself to its environment vibrationally.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in one experiment, if you treated a cup of water with a specific vibrational frequency the water would change itself to that specific vibration and it would stay like that forever. It would only change if it came across a different vibration.\r\n\r\nThis vibrated water if ingested directly and instantly affects our body''s biological functions. Depending on the vibrational frequency of the water, different illnesses can be treated.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from my research is that if you add a chemical into a solution and then remove all traces of that chemical from the solution, the specific chemical vibrational remains which has the same biological affect as if the chemical were still in the water. The body recognises the new vibration and reacts accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis idea has radical implications for our health as it means that not only do we have to question the water that we drink but also our environment in which we live which is saturated with man made vibrations from all of the electronic machinery that we use in our every day lives. What damage are they in fact doing to our health? The good part is that a <strong>''Repair mechanism''</strong> exists. Thats the only reason why the Human species survived on earth for more than a million years without doctors.\r\n\r\nSo hopefully, in these few paragraphs I have shown that it is scientifically logical for homeopathic treatments to work, through the properties of vibrations. The problem that I have, however, is this: <strong>how do homeopathic treatments work</strong> when they are in solid pill form. For this I do not have the answers. I can only confirm that homeopathy is a very simple science in principle when it is in a solution and should be embraced by the scientific community.\r\n\r\nNow some supporting data from BHA: British Homeopathic association\r\n\r\n<strong>RCT</strong>: Randomised placebo-Controlled Trials\r\n\r\nDifficulties and opportunities with RCTs\r\n\r\nThe RCT model of measuring efficacy of a drug poses some challenges for homeopathic research. In homeopathy, treatment is usually tailored to the individual. A homeopathic prescription is based not only on the symptoms of disease in the patient but also on a host of other factors that are particular to that patient, including lifestyle, emotional health, personality, eating habits and medical history. The “efficacy” of an individualised homeopathic intervention is thus a complex blend of the prescribed medicine together with the other facets of the in-depth consultation and integrated health advice provided by the practitioner; under these circumstances, the specific effect of the homeopathic medicine itself may be difficult to quantify with precision in RCTs.\r\n\r\nThe dilutions and the memory of water theory\r\n\r\nThe aspect of homeopathy that is implausible for many people is that the medicines are often – though by no means always – diluted to the point where there may be no molecules of original substance left. One of the leading current proposals for how such ‘ultramolecular’ dilutions work is that water is capable of storing information relating to substances with which it has previously been in contact.\r\n\r\nThe structure of water\r\n\r\nRecent research on hydrogen bonds in water provides some support for this ‘memory’ theory. The Swiss chemist, Louis Rey, found that the structure of hydrogen bonds in homeopathic dilutions of salt solutions is very different from that in pure water. He reached the conclusion that the phenomenon results from the vigorous shaking of solutions that takes place during homeopathic ‘succussion’. Moreover, using the laboratory technique called spectroscopy, other researchers have found that different homeopathic medicines and different dilutions of the same medicine can be distinguished from each other, even though all should contain nothing but water.\r\n\r\nMolecular clusters\r\n\r\nAn alternative mechanism is suggested by the results of research from South Korea. Studies on molecular clustering in water solutions showed that as a solution is made more and more dilute, very stable and larger ‘clumps’ of material develop in dilute solutions rather than in more concentrated solutions.  This means that residual molecular clusters of the original substance might just be present in homeopathic dilutions. Succussion might also be responsible for creating very tiny bubbles (nanobubbles) that could contain gaseous inclusions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and possibly the homeopathic source material.3\r\n\r\nHighly diluted substances exert an effect\r\n\r\nHowever they work, there is increasing evidence that homeopathic dilutions have a demonstrable effect on living organisms examined under laboratory conditions. Researchers in Germany have observed an inhibitory effect of an ultra-diluted chemical on the bacterium Vibrio fischeri.  And there is important work from a consortium of European laboratories showing that very high dilutions of histamine may exert a biologically significant effect on the white blood cells that take part in the immune response.\r\n\r\n<strong>Positive outcomes in 75% of studies</strong>\r\n\r\nViewing the evidence overall, there is some experimental support for the idea that ultra-molecular homeopathic dilutions may possess unique physical properties and can exert physiological effects. A systematic review evaluated 67 in-vitro experiments in 75 publications of research on homeopathic dilutions.7 A majority of papers reported measurable effects from highly diluted substances. Positive findings were obtained in nearly three-quarters of all replicated studies, but no positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000.

Such an intense training is available only in some countries like India.\r\n\r\nIt is very important the homeopath is able to understand the medical language, able to read and evaluate all kinds of investigations modalities (such as blood work, ECG, X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Electromyelogram, EEG, etc.) and apply in practice, to determine and decide the treatment protocol.\r\n\r\nIn many European countries including the UK as well as the US, there are courses for lay people which may legally permit them to practice homeopathy. However, such courses are not adequate in the medical training and it is highly debatable if such practitioners could be called ''homeopaths''. The problem with such homeopaths is that they fail to understand the diseases in medical perspective.\r\n\r\nA homeopath should have either a post-graduation or at least a graduation qualification in medicine. Medical qualification for homeopaths varies from country to country. However, it is important that every ''homeopath'' has adequate training in all medical subjects as above. Most countries have courses in homeopathy minimum after 12 years with science subjects. Homeopathy course has to be a ''graduation'' course after science subjects. It cannot be a short-term course with the background in commerce or arts subjects. In some countries, there are ''medical homeopaths'' while in some countries there are also ''lay-homeopaths''.\r\n<h2 class="page-title">Homeopathy use around the world</h2>\r\n<h3><span class="accent">Worldwide</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Worldwide, over 200 million people use homeopathy on a regular basis.<sup><a title="Prasad R.

Such an intense training is available only in some countries like India.\r\n\r\nIt is very important the homeopath is able to understand the medical language, able to read and evaluate all kinds of investigations modalities (such as blood work, ECG, X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Electromyelogram, EEG, etc.) and apply in practice, to determine and decide the treatment protocol.\r\n\r\nIn many European countries including the UK as well as the US, there are courses for lay people which may legally permit them to practice homeopathy. However, such courses are not adequate in the medical training and it is highly debatable if such practitioners could be called ''homeopaths''. The problem with such homeopaths is that they fail to understand the diseases in medical perspective.\r\n\r\nA homeopath should have either a post-graduation or at least a graduation qualification in medicine. Medical qualification for homeopaths varies from country to country. However, it is important that every ''homeopath'' has adequate training in all medical subjects as above. Most countries have courses in homeopathy minimum after 12 years with science subjects. Homeopathy course has to be a ''graduation'' course after science subjects. It cannot be a short-term course with the background in commerce or arts subjects. In some countries, there are ''medical homeopaths'' while in some countries there are also ''lay-homeopaths''.\r\n<h2 class="page-title">Homeopathy use around the world</h2>\r\n<h3><span class="accent">Worldwide</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Worldwide, over 200 million people use homeopathy on a regular basis.<sup><a title="Prasad R.

We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as an exhausting work schedule or a difficult relationship. However, anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. This includes positive events such as getting married, buying a house, going to college, or receiving a promotion.\r\nOf course, not all stress is caused by external factors. Stress can also be internal or self-generated, when you worry excessively about something that may or may not happen, or have irrational, pessimistic thoughts about life.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is stress?</strong>\r\n\r\nStress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you feel threatened, your nervous system responds by releasing a flood of stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, which rouse the body for emergency action. Your heart pounds faster, muscles tighten, blood pressure rises, breath quickens, and your senses become sharper. These physical changes increase your strength and stamina, speed your reaction time, and enhance your focus. This is known as the “fight or flight” or mobilization stress response and is your body’s way of protecting you.\r\nWhen stress is within your comfort zone, it can help you to stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life—giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. Stress can also help you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you''d rather be watching TV. But beyond your comfort zone, stress stops being helpful and can start causing major damage to your mind and body leading to disease.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the effects of chronic stress?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe body’s nervous system often does a poor job of distinguishing between daily stressors and life-threatening events. If you’re stressed over an argument with a friend, a traffic jam on your commute, or a mountain of bills, for example, your body can still react as if you’re facing a life-or-death situation.\r\nWhen you repeatedly experience the mobilization or fight-or-flight stress response in your daily life, it can lead to serious health problems. Chronic stress disrupts nearly every system in your body. It can shut down your immune system, upset your digestive and reproductive systems, raise blood pressure, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, speed up the aging process and leave you vulnerable to many mental and physical health problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Try our Stress Calculator now by installing it on your android phone.</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2507" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2507" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-4-2-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /> US consul General, His Excellency Peter Haas giving the award of OutStanding Achiever to Dr. Shreepad Khedekar[/caption]\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000.

It can shut down your immune system, upset your digestive and reproductive systems, raise blood pressure, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, speed up the aging process and leave you vulnerable to many mental and physical health problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Try our Stress Calculator now by installing it on your android phone.</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2507" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2507" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-4-2-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /> US consul General, His Excellency Peter Haas giving the award of OutStanding Achiever to Dr. Shreepad Khedekar[/caption]\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000.

Read: 5 shocking things that can increase the risk of autism in children.\r\n\r\nConvention treatment for autism leaves a lot to be desired since it only focuses on treating the symptoms of the disorder and not the child. The world is now slowly waking up to the powers of alternative medicines especially when it comes to treating disorders on the autistic spectrum. One such discipline that has seen brilliant results in not only treating but also reversing autism is homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, World Homeopathy Day, we spoke to renowned homoeopath Dr Shreepad Khedekar from Imperial Clinics about his take on autism and how homoeopathy works towards stimulating the child’s DNA to correct the disorder, helping him or her cure autism rather than learning how to function around it. Dr Khedekar is an authority in the field of paediatric developmental disorder management, and he has initiated a seven-year-old international study involving children with issues such as delayed development, autism, tuberous sclerosis, dyspraxia, borderline Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and cerebral palsy. Autism treatment in homeopathy, Autism recovery homeopathy how is that possible? How is ADHD homeopathic treatment done, will homeopathy for ADHD work?\r\n\r\n<strong>What is wrong with conventional treatment methods?</strong>\r\n\r\n“In autism, there is a complete breakdown in coordination between mental activities,” says Dr Khedekar. “In the conventional system of medicine, the treatment for autism is not the best; it, in fact, is very suppressive in nature. Remedies are given to suppress the hyperactivity of child can be suppressed, or they try to take care of the secondary effects of autism, like its complications. The answer to curing rather than just managing autism lies in the DNA of the child according to Dr Khedekar. “The repair has to be done at the level of the child’s DNA. Only then can you bring it out of autism. This is what I call the genetic repair process. Through homoeopathy, we stimulate the child’s own repair mechanism,” he adds. The focus of the treatment and management through homoeopathy is not to treat the isolated symptoms of the developmental disorder, but to treat the child as a whole and help in building up the personality traits of the child from the time of the treatment.\r\n\r\n<strong>What causes autism according to homoeopathy?</strong>\r\n\r\nDr Khedekar says that it is difficult to pinpoint exact causes of autism. But in his experience, he has come across certain factors that were common in most of the cases.\r\n\r\n•    Stress during pregnancy- Dr Khedekar says, “50% of the time, stress during pregnancy is a positive finding. Mother’s mental health during the time of pregnancy can impact the development of the child. “In most cases, the mother was going through stress during pregnancy such problems with the husband or the in-laws,” recounts Dr Khedekar.\r\n\r\n•    Mercurial compounds in vaccines – “Some newly introduced vaccines can be a trigger for autism mainly due to their mercurial compounds,” states Dr Khedekar. “Although there are no studies to support this, I have found this to be a trigger in my experience.”\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the signs of autism in children?</strong>\r\n\r\nDr Khedekar says that the initial symptoms of the disorder start showing at two years of age. Following are some of the most conspicuous symptoms of the disorder.\r\n\r\n•    Lack of eye contact in the child\r\n\r\n•    No separation anxiety is seen in the child on being taken away from its parents\r\n\r\n•    No emotional attachment towards parents or caregivers\r\n\r\n•    Prefers to stay alone and play solitary games\r\n\r\n•    Does not make friends\r\n\r\n•    Impaired verbal skills. Cannot make full sentences\r\n\r\n•    Repetitive activities like pinching oneself, banging head, rubbing genitals\r\n\r\n•    Attachment towards inanimate objects like toys\r\n\r\nAlthough the symptoms start showing only after two years, the actual damage happens when the child is in the womb. “When the mother is going through stress, the child, even in utero, uses its intelligence to fend off the effects of the adverse conditions in its mother’s womb,” he says. This is when the developmental disorder starts taking shape.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does homoeopathy treat autism?</strong>\r\n\r\n•    Good behaviour therapy – The child has to be left in the care of a therapist who can mould the child’s behaviour. This will bring out a positive change in the child who will be taught basic skills like looking, listening, reading, conversing and mimicking.\r\n\r\n•    A good diet – In Dr Khedekar’s experience with autistic children, he has found that most have some sensitivity to proteins such as casein (found commonly in milk) and gluten. “A diet free of these two can go a long way in helping the child fight autism,” he emphasises.\r\n\r\n•      A good homoeopathic remedy- Finally, formulating the right homoeopathic remedy is the last step in curing the child. For this, prescriptions should be made through observations. The child has to be understood as a whole and not just as a clutch of symptoms. So understanding the child’s mind and body is important in curing autism.\r\n\r\n<strong>How homoeopathy works</strong>\r\n\r\nTo formulate a similimum or a cure, a homoeopath has to observe the child acutely for its behaviour and preferences. “The doctor makes a note of the child’s behaviour, whether it is screaming, shouting, crawling or performing repetitive behaviours. He will also observe whether the child prefers warmer or cooler temperatures or sweet or sour foods,” the doctor states. This, according to Dr Khedekar, gives the homoeopath insights into the child’s genetic makeup, which will in turn help in formulating the right homoeopathic remedy. Once the remedy is administered, the genetic reversal is triggered and the child is cured.\r\n\r\n<strong>Way forward</strong>\r\n\r\nSceptics should know that autistic children treated with homoeopathy were monitored by Dr Khedekar in a seven-year-long study. Pre and post-treatment observations have found that 80 percent of these children are living physically and psychologically balanced lives! Even when convention medicine gropes in the dark looking for answers, homoeopathy has proved that a seemingly complex disorder like autism can be reversed with simple and holistic steps.\r\n\r\n<em>Dr Shreepad Khedekar has treated world famous <strong>Tennis Star Novak Djokovic </strong>for asthma. Has also cured many European football stars playing the European Premier League.

This is when the developmental disorder starts taking shape.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does homoeopathy treat autism?</strong>\r\n\r\n•    Good behaviour therapy – The child has to be left in the care of a therapist who can mould the child’s behaviour. This will bring out a positive change in the child who will be taught basic skills like looking, listening, reading, conversing and mimicking.\r\n\r\n•    A good diet – In Dr Khedekar’s experience with autistic children, he has found that most have some sensitivity to proteins such as casein (found commonly in milk) and gluten. “A diet free of these two can go a long way in helping the child fight autism,” he emphasises.\r\n\r\n•      A good homoeopathic remedy- Finally, formulating the right homoeopathic remedy is the last step in curing the child. For this, prescriptions should be made through observations. The child has to be understood as a whole and not just as a clutch of symptoms. So understanding the child’s mind and body is important in curing autism.\r\n\r\n<strong>How homoeopathy works</strong>\r\n\r\nTo formulate a similimum or a cure, a homoeopath has to observe the child acutely for its behaviour and preferences. “The doctor makes a note of the child’s behaviour, whether it is screaming, shouting, crawling or performing repetitive behaviours. He will also observe whether the child prefers warmer or cooler temperatures or sweet or sour foods,” the doctor states. This, according to Dr Khedekar, gives the homoeopath insights into the child’s genetic makeup, which will in turn help in formulating the right homoeopathic remedy. Once the remedy is administered, the genetic reversal is triggered and the child is cured.\r\n\r\n<strong>Way forward</strong>\r\n\r\nSceptics should know that autistic children treated with homoeopathy were monitored by Dr Khedekar in a seven-year-long study. Pre and post-treatment observations have found that 80 percent of these children are living physically and psychologically balanced lives! Even when convention medicine gropes in the dark looking for answers, homoeopathy has proved that a seemingly complex disorder like autism can be reversed with simple and holistic steps.\r\n\r\n<em>Dr Shreepad Khedekar has treated world famous <strong>Tennis Star Novak Djokovic </strong>for asthma. Has also cured many European football stars playing the European Premier League. Has his own practice in Europe and believes in research, has submitted hundreds of case studies to medical journals internationally. He is a physician, teacher, researcher, and author. He has written four books on Homeopathy. He operates through his clinics in Dadar and Belgrade and is also a consultant at Shushrusha Hospital, Mumbai.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>For more details: www.imperialclinics.com</em></strong>\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath.

In these ‘Golden Years’, many elderly people with Alzheimer’s wage a losing battle against their own body in a bid to preserve their sanity. Eventually, Alzheimer’s leaves them with no choice but to concede defeat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who is at risk?</strong>\r\n• Those with a rare gene mutation – Dr Khedekar says, “The risk of developing Alzheimer’s is higher if a first-degree relative, like parents or siblings, have it. People with rare gene mutation Apolipoprotein E4 (APoE4) is linked to early-onset Alzheimer’s symptoms as early as their 30s.”\r\n• The elderly – “Increasing age is the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s. The ailment is not a part of normal ageing, but its risk increases significantly after the age of 65. The risk doubles every decade after age 60,” says the doctor.\r\n• More women than men – Dr Khedekar says that more females than males are at greater risk, attributed to the fact that women live longer than men. “Women carrying a copy of APoE4 gene are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s as compared to men may be due to gene interaction with oestrogen,” adds the doctor.\r\n• Head traumas and strokes – “Physical trauma as in accident where the brain suffers significant damage, or medical conditions like stroke or lack of oxygen can predispose one to Alzheimer’s,” states Dr Khedekar.\r\nWhat are the limitations of conventional treatment for Alzheimer’s?\r\nDr Khedekar says that allopathy has very less to offer for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. “Considering that it only has palliative drugs like Tacrine, Rivastigmine, Galantamine, Donepezil and Memantine which work as Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, allopathy only has marginal benefits and that too with many side effects.” In stark contrast with this is homeopathy, which treats the sufferer at a holistic level and helps the sufferer’s body correct the pathology on its own accord, without ANY side effects.\r\n“If diagnosed early, homeopathic remedies can help in significantly arresting or even possibly reversing the disease,” says the doctor. Some of the remedies used for treating Alzheimer’s are:\r\n• Gelsemium\r\n• Nux Vomica\r\n• Mercurius\r\n• Baryta Carbonica\r\n• Conium\r\n• Lycopodium\r\n• Alumina\r\n• Natrum Sulphur\r\nHow can one reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s?\r\n• Mind -The key to reducing Alzheimer’s risk according to Dr Khedekar is to keep the mind occupied and active. “Mentally stimulating activities like learning a new language or playing puzzles, games and solving problems can prevent brain atrophy,” he states. “Music therapy has also helped to a large extent.”\r\n• Body- It goes without saying that a healthy lifestyle goes a long way in preventing any degenerative disease. “Cardiovascular exercising can help. A healthy diet, social engagement and intellectual stimulation are known to reduce risk factors for Alzheimer’s,” says Dr Khedekar.\r\nHow can caregivers help, in addition to homeopathic treatment?\r\nCaring for someone with Alzheimer’s can be demanding; suddenly, someone whom you have known all your life behaves abnormally, displays aggression or wanders far away from home. “Memory and language loss, impaired judgment, and other cognitive changes caused by Alzheimer’s can also complicate treatment for other health conditions; therefore caregiver may have to cope with a lot of mental and physical challenges,” adds Dr Khedekar. “Becoming well-informed about the disease is one important long-term strategy.”\r\nApart from this, the doctor prescribes good coping skills, a strong support network and respite care to help caregivers handle the stress of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2507" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2507" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-4-2-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /> US consul General, His Excellency Peter Haas giving the award of OutStanding Achiever to Dr. Shreepad Khedekar[/caption]\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000.

Hahnemann performed experiments on himself using Peruvian bark, which contains quinine, a malaria<b> </b>remedy. He concluded that in a healthy person, quinine creates the same symptoms as malaria, including fevers and chills , which is the reason why it is effective as a remedy. He then began to analyze the remedies available in nature by what he called provings. Provings of homeopathic remedies are still compiled by dosing healthy adults with various substances and documenting the results, in terms of the dose needed to produce the symptoms and the length of the dose''s effectiveness. The provings are collected in large homeopathic references called <i>materia medica</i> or materials of medicine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hahnemann formulated these principles of homeopathy:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Law of Similars (like cures like)</li>\r\n 	<li>Law of the Infinitesimal Dose (The more diluted a remedy is, the more potent it is)</li>\r\n 	<li>Illness is specific to the individual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHahnemann''s Law of Similars was based on thinking that dated back to <a

Hahnemann performed experiments on himself using Peruvian bark, which contains quinine, a malaria<b> </b>remedy. He concluded that in a healthy person, quinine creates the same symptoms as malaria, including fevers and chills , which is the reason why it is effective as a remedy. He then began to analyze the remedies available in nature by what he called provings. Provings of homeopathic remedies are still compiled by dosing healthy adults with various substances and documenting the results, in terms of the dose needed to produce the symptoms and the length of the dose''s effectiveness. The provings are collected in large homeopathic references called <i>materia medica</i> or materials of medicine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hahnemann formulated these principles of homeopathy:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Law of Similars (like cures like)</li>\r\n 	<li>Law of the Infinitesimal Dose (The more diluted a remedy is, the more potent it is)</li>\r\n 	<li>Illness is specific to the individual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHahnemann''s Law of Similars was based on thinking that dated back to <a

When people talk about bronchial asthma, they are really talking about asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes periodic "attacks" of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, more than 25 million Americans, including 6.8 million children under age 18, suffer with asthma today.\r\n\r\nAllergies are strongly linked to asthma and to other respiratory diseases such as chronic sinusitis, middle ear infections, and nasal polyps. Most interestingly, a recent analysis of people with asthma showed that those who had both allergies and asthma were much more likely to have nighttime awakening due to asthma, miss work because of asthma, and require more powerful medications to control their symptoms.\r\n\r\nAsthma is associated with mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes. Mast cells are the allergy-causing cells that release chemicals like histamine. Histamine is the substance that causes nasal stuffiness and dripping in a cold or hay fever, constriction of airways in asthma, and itchy areas in a skin allergy. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell associated with allergic disease. T lymphocytes are also white blood cells associated with allergy and inflammation.\r\n\r\nThese cells, along with other inflammatory cells, are involved in the development of airway inflammation in asthma that contributes to the airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and chronic disease. In certain individuals, the inflammation results in the feelings of chest tightness and breathlessness that''s felt often at night (nocturnal asthma) or in the early morning hours.

You might also notice when the symptoms occur such as during exercise, with a cold, or after smelling smoke. Asthma tests may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><b>Spirometry:</b> A lung function test to measure breathing capacity and how well you breathe. You will breathe into a device called a spirometer.</li>\r\n 	<li><b>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF):</b> Using a device called a peak flow meter, you forcefully exhale into the tube to measure the force of air you can expend out of your lungs. Peak flow monitoring can allow you to monitor how well your asthma is doing at home.</li>\r\n 	<li><b>Chest X-ray:</b> Your doctor may do a chest X-ray to rule out any other diseases that may be causing similar symptoms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAsthma is a very common condition affecting five per cent of the population at one stage of life. In the Western world, up to ten per cent of children have the disease. It is certainly not confined to our epoch – Seneca the younger, a powerful Roman leader and historic figure of the theatre, described his asthma as his “last gasp”. However, he was something of a celebrity during his age and his demise was certainly not due to asthma!\r\n\r\nIn asthma the bronchial tubes narrow and this makes it more difficult to breathe. Symptoms that occur in asthma are chest tightness, coughing, wheezy breathing and shortness of breath. These symptoms may simply occur when the body has to work harder – such as on walking quickly, going upstairs or running. House dust may provoke an asthma attack if there is a history of allergy as may exposure to cat, dog or horse hair. People who suffer from hay fever may find that they get asthma-like symptoms too. It is helpful to find out if the asthma is caused by an allergy as this can offer some direction that treatment with homeopathy may pursue. Asthma patients may have a personal or family history of hay fever and/or eczema, as these conditions tend to exist together.\r\n\r\n<b>Conventional treatment\r\n</b>In terms of conventional treatment, the medication available can offer reasonable control of symptoms. Bronchodilator inhalers (available on prescription) such as Salbutamol (Ventolin) and Bricanyl (Terbutaline) are designed to act on the muscles of the airways and help the air flow through. You could think of the airways as tunnels, which narrow down when there is asthma. The bronchodilators are the workmen which widen the tunnel allowing greater flow of air (the traffic). There are also steroid inhalers such as Becotide (Beclomethasone) and Pulmicort (Budesonide) which you could imagine to be the workmen who do the maintenance work in the tunnel preventing the build up of debris or do things which keep the tunnel nice and wide – they act by reducing the inflammation. If used well and if the asthma is not severe, inhalers such as Becotide can do a good job. If someone has asthma and they are already on conventional medicine I would strongly recommend that they do not stop their medication or alter it without deciding this together with a doctor. Stopping medication can result in a flaring up of the asthma and this may be confused with a homeopathic aggravation, or worse, it could be potentially very serious.\r\n\r\nNevertheless sometimes people do not like the thought of taking these drugs and of the side effects that can occur. The side effects of Salbutamol are generally mild and steroids used short term rarely cause problems but the long term use of steroids even if inhaled may lead to potential problems if large doses are used. Initially homeopathic treatment may be used alongside conventional treatment but eventually we wish for a reduction in inhaler use and hopefully we can wean the patient off them provided that homeopathy gives a result as good or better than that obtained with inhalers.\r\n<h2>Side-Effects of Conventional Treatments</h2>\r\nConventional asthma medications are split into two main groups. One group dilates the constricted airways (bronchodilators) while the second group reduces inflammation.\r\n\r\nBoth groups consist of medicines that can either prevent or relieve asthma. They may be prescribed for short-term or long-term use and can be either swallowed or inhaled.\r\n\r\nThose that are inhaled usually have fewer side effects because they work directly on the lungs. Those are swallowed affect the whole body and so produce a greater range of side-effects.\r\n\r\nWhat all of these medicines have in common is that they only ever manage the symptoms of asthma, never cure them. Knowing that, let’s look at their side effects:\r\n\r\nInhaled bronchodilators: These medications are marketed as being relatively safe and effective. Side-effects, such as an increased heart rate and muscle shakes, usually wear off with time so are classified as minor problems. Overuse of these medications has been known to worsen asthma and increase the possibility of death.\r\n\r\nTablet or liquid bronchodilators: Systemic bronchodilator medications such as theophylline affect the whole body rather than just the lungs and so have a greater number of unpleasant side effects. These include: mood and behavioural changes; increased urination; allergic reactions; confusion; diarrhoea; dizziness; sleeplessness; nausea and vomiting; tremors; irregular heartbeats; and persistent headaches. Theophylline blood levels should be checked regularly to ensure the proper dose is being taken.\r\n\r\nInhaled anti-inflammatories: Again, because this type of corticosteroid medication is delivered straight to the lungs, side-effects are less common than when corticosteroids are taken orally. The main side-effect is yeast (thrush) in the mouth and throat leading to pain and hoarseness. The growth rate of children can also be slowed by this medication, especially if overused.\r\n\r\nTablet or liquid anti-inflammatories: Systemic corticosteroid medications are prescribed to reverse severe episodes of difficult-to-control asthma. They have serious side-effects, especially when used for long periods of time. For this reason they are only used as a last resort and for as short a period as possible. Side effects include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Mood swings or depression, especially in children,</li>\r\n 	<li>Increased appetite and weight gain,</li>\r\n 	<li>Fattened, ‘moon’ face,</li>\r\n 	<li>Thinning of the skin,</li>\r\n 	<li>Restlessness and hyperactivity,</li>\r\n 	<li>Sleep disturbances,</li>\r\n 	<li>Heartburn and indigestion,</li>\r\n 	<li>Easy bruising,</li>\r\n 	<li>Worsening or triggering of diabetes,</li>\r\n 	<li>Osteoporosis (brittle bones),</li>\r\n 	<li>Cataracts of the eyes,</li>\r\n 	<li>Muscle weakness,</li>\r\n 	<li>Reduced resistance to infection,</li>\r\n 	<li>High blood pressure,</li>\r\n 	<li>Impaired growth in children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe good news is that by treating your asthma with homoeopathy all of the above side-effects can be avoided and your asthma symptoms are far more likely to reduce over time and clear completely. Let’s hear from two men who are currently being treated for their long-term asthma.\r\n<h2>Show Me the Research</h2>\r\nHomoeopathy has consistently been effective in the treatment of asthma and other allergies in studies and double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Let’s take a look at a few of them.\r\n\r\nStudy One: A 1998 study involving 63 adults and children with asthma showed that of those given the homoeopathic remedy, 97% improved, 2.6% worsened, and 87.2% reduced their use of conventional medication. In contrast, of those given a placebo (dummy medicine), 12.5% improved, 16.7% stayed the same, and 70.8% worsened. None who received the placebo reduced their use of conventional medication.\r\n\r\nStudy Two: A 1997 study of 40 asthma patients who were dependent on corticosteroid drugs showed that during the course of the study, those given the homoeopathic remedy reduced their use of corticosteroids and experienced greater improvement in their asthma than those who were given the placebo.\r\n\r\nStudy Three: A 2006 Norwegian study of 200 patients suffering hypersensitivity illnesses, including asthma, showed that homoeopathy was at least as effective as conventional treatment but with none of the side effects. Those who received homoeopathy also reported a greater improvement in overall physical and mental-emotional health than those who did not.\r\n<h2><b>Homeopathic treatment\r\n</b><strong>So what homeopathic medicines are available to treat asthma? Asthma like any other condition can be treated with homeopathy at various levels. The ideal would be to find the treatment, which reflects the Similimum of the case (or as near to the Similimum as possible). By Similimum, I mean the remedy that best matches the person not just in terms of his symptoms but also in terms of his psyche and the way that he relates to other people and to life generally. This would offer a deeper prospect of healing. However finding the Similimum may not always be possible and there are many remedies which may be given for the symptoms of asthma. There are also remedies that can be given for the causes of allergic asthma (homeopathic preparations of house dust mite, grasses and pollens etc). Asthma is a condition for which I would highly recommend professional treatment – I would not advocate self-treatment. Here are the outlines of a few remedies, which may be helpful in the treatment of asthma.</strong></h2>\r\n<h2>Treat your Asthma with Homeopathy</h2>\r\nHomeopathy should be the treatment of choice for asthma and other allergies. It is safe and effective for babies through to the elderly. It is important to note that asthma is a chronic complaint best treated by a qualified homeopath. While some remedies discussed in this article will be found in many home-use kits because they can also treat a range of acute problems, the successful treatment of asthma frequently needs potencies and changes of remedies beyond the scope of a home kit and prescriber. <strong>For the best results please use the services of a fully qualified homeopath.</strong> The homeopathic remedies needed for asthma also vary according to the symptoms of the sufferer but some of the main ones are listed below.\r\n<h3>Antimonium Tartaricum (Ant-t.)</h3>\r\nKey Symptoms: Rattling breathing and wet sounding cough with mucus that is hard to cough up. Want to be fanned. Breathlessness worse for heat.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Especially useful for young children or elderly patients. Irritable and want to be left alone. Do not want to be examined or touched. Weakness. Occasional expectoration of small amounts of yellow, sticky mucus.\r\n\r\nComments: This is a remedy for many complaints that are accompanied by difficult breathing. While it can be indicated at any age it is frequently needed at the extremes of life – i.e., infancy or old age. The person may be drowsy or lethargic its. The respiration will often be rattling but there will be difficulty in coughing up the mucus that is obviously present. Breathing may become so difficult that the person can be bluish and sound as though they are about to suffocate. In severe cases heart failure may be present. Ant-t is also a remedy that can be used during cholera and chickenpox when indicated by the symptoms.\r\n\r\n<strong>Arsenicum Album (Ars.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Wheezing may be present but the cough will be dry. Asthma from cold air. Asthma worse for lying; must sit upright or bent forward to breathe.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma triggered by dampness, cold food or drinks, or watery fruit. Wheezing from allergies to cats, smoke, or dust. Thirsty for sips of warm drinks.\r\n\r\nComments: One of the most common remedies for acute asthma. The person will be restless and anxious, and symptoms are usually worse between midnight and 3 am. At times, the restlessness will lead to exhaustion. They will feel chilly and better for warmth, and feel better for sipping warm drinks. Those who need Ars. constitutionally are likely to be nervous, anxious, critical, and afraid of being alone. They are often perfectionists, have to keep things meticulously tidy, and can be hard to please. Burning sensations that feel better for warmth and often accompanied they are problems. Headaches however will be relieved by cold applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Grindelia (Grin.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Dry asthma. Wheezing may be present but the cough will be dry.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Chronic bronchitis. Rattling respiration. Expectoration of profuse sticky mucus improves asthma. Suffocating sensation on falling asleep. Sleep apnoea. Breathing improved by sitting or standing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kali Bichromicum (Kali-bi.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma with sticky or stringy mucus. Breathing better if coughing up mucous. Cough worsened by eating.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma often dissociated with bronchitis, sinusitis, or postnasal dripping. Wheezing during sleep.\r\n\r\nComments: These patients feel cold, and get sick after being chilled. Despite this, they feel worse in summer. They get mucous membrane infections, mostly in the respiratory tract. The mucous will be gluey, thick, stringy and sticky. It may start out clear and then turn white or green, and can cause ulceration. Pains can appear in many parts of the body, can migrate quickly, and can be precisely located (the patient can put a finger on the spot where the pain is). They may suffer from ulcers, including stomach ulcers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Nux Vomica (Nux-v.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Allergic asthma. Symptoms worse at 4am or on waking in the morning.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma may be a associated with digestive complaints. Asthma triggered by cold air. Asthma worsened by eating. Asthma improved by warm drinks. Asthma from overindulgence with alcohol, food, or recreational drugs.\r\n\r\nComments: The first remedy to look at for hangovers, nausea and vomiting. Patients tend to overdo both work and play. They can work long hours and then have trouble sleeping at night due to business anxieties or nervous exhaustion. They will overindulge in food, alcohol, and stimulants (especially coffee), and may regret it later – as with a hangover. They can be irritable, short tempered, nervy and do not suffer fools gladly. They are at their worst in the morning or in cold weather. They tend to be neat and tidy, and expect the same from others. Pains may be cramping and spasmodic. Their stomach may feel heavy and sensetive to pressure. They are also very sensitive to smells and light.\r\n\r\n<strong>Phosphorus (Phos.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma from upper respiratory tract infections (head colds) that go down to the chest. Asthma with coughing and wheezing.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma worse from lying on the left side – may improves on lying on the right side. Hoarseness with asthma. Tickling and irritating cough. Asthma from odours (even flowers) and fumes.\r\n\r\nPulsatilla Pratensis (Puls.)\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma from allergies. Asthma worse for warm, stuffy rooms and better in the open air. Asthma with thirstlessness.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: ‘Juicy’ or green mucus with asthma. Asthma better the cold air or air conditioning. Breathing better for sitting propped up. Asthma with conjunctivitis and itchy eyes. Asthma from cats. Asthma worse at night.\r\n\r\nComments: Patients will be clingy, needy, sensitive, emotional and shy. Often they will have blue eyes and blond hair, and are likable. They can whine and be irritable, and are most often women or children. They are also very sensitive and can be hurt by even slight criticism. They may be chilly or warm-blooded, but in either case can’t stand stuffy rooms and feel better for fresh air. Discharges are bland, thick and yellow or green. Their emotions can change quickly and unexpected, as in from tears to laughter in a matter of minutes. They bend easily, and crave sympathy and attention from others, and make friends easily.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

When people talk about bronchial asthma, they are really talking about asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes periodic "attacks" of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, more than 25 million Americans, including 6.8 million children under age 18, suffer with asthma today.\r\n\r\nAllergies are strongly linked to asthma and to other respiratory diseases such as chronic sinusitis, middle ear infections, and nasal polyps. Most interestingly, a recent analysis of people with asthma showed that those who had both allergies and asthma were much more likely to have nighttime awakening due to asthma, miss work because of asthma, and require more powerful medications to control their symptoms.\r\n\r\nAsthma is associated with mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes. Mast cells are the allergy-causing cells that release chemicals like histamine. Histamine is the substance that causes nasal stuffiness and dripping in a cold or hay fever, constriction of airways in asthma, and itchy areas in a skin allergy. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell associated with allergic disease. T lymphocytes are also white blood cells associated with allergy and inflammation.\r\n\r\nThese cells, along with other inflammatory cells, are involved in the development of airway inflammation in asthma that contributes to the airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and chronic disease. In certain individuals, the inflammation results in the feelings of chest tightness and breathlessness that''s felt often at night (nocturnal asthma) or in the early morning hours. Others only feel symptoms when they exercise (called exercise-induced asthma). <strong>Dr. Shreepad A. Khedekar has treated world famous Novak Djokovic for his EIA (exercise induced Asthma).</strong> Because of the inflammation, the airway hyperresponsiveness occurs as a result of specific triggers.\r\n\r\n<section>\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2247" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2247" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0008-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> Novak Djokovic with Dr. Shreepad A.

The growth rate of children can also be slowed by this medication, especially if overused.\r\n\r\nTablet or liquid anti-inflammatories: Systemic corticosteroid medications are prescribed to reverse severe episodes of difficult-to-control asthma. They have serious side-effects, especially when used for long periods of time. For this reason they are only used as a last resort and for as short a period as possible. Side effects include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Mood swings or depression, especially in children,</li>\r\n 	<li>Increased appetite and weight gain,</li>\r\n 	<li>Fattened, ‘moon’ face,</li>\r\n 	<li>Thinning of the skin,</li>\r\n 	<li>Restlessness and hyperactivity,</li>\r\n 	<li>Sleep disturbances,</li>\r\n 	<li>Heartburn and indigestion,</li>\r\n 	<li>Easy bruising,</li>\r\n 	<li>Worsening or triggering of diabetes,</li>\r\n 	<li>Osteoporosis (brittle bones),</li>\r\n 	<li>Cataracts of the eyes,</li>\r\n 	<li>Muscle weakness,</li>\r\n 	<li>Reduced resistance to infection,</li>\r\n 	<li>High blood pressure,</li>\r\n 	<li>Impaired growth in children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe good news is that by treating your asthma with homoeopathy all of the above side-effects can be avoided and your asthma symptoms are far more likely to reduce over time and clear completely. Let’s hear from two men who are currently being treated for their long-term asthma.\r\n<h2>Show Me the Research</h2>\r\nHomoeopathy has consistently been effective in the treatment of asthma and other allergies in studies and double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Let’s take a look at a few of them.\r\n\r\nStudy One: A 1998 study involving 63 adults and children with asthma showed that of those given the homoeopathic remedy, 97% improved, 2.6% worsened, and 87.2% reduced their use of conventional medication. In contrast, of those given a placebo (dummy medicine), 12.5% improved, 16.7% stayed the same, and 70.8% worsened. None who received the placebo reduced their use of conventional medication.\r\n\r\nStudy Two: A 1997 study of 40 asthma patients who were dependent on corticosteroid drugs showed that during the course of the study, those given the homoeopathic remedy reduced their use of corticosteroids and experienced greater improvement in their asthma than those who were given the placebo.\r\n\r\nStudy Three: A 2006 Norwegian study of 200 patients suffering hypersensitivity illnesses, including asthma, showed that homoeopathy was at least as effective as conventional treatment but with none of the side effects. Those who received homoeopathy also reported a greater improvement in overall physical and mental-emotional health than those who did not.\r\n<h2><b>Homeopathic treatment\r\n</b><strong>So what homeopathic medicines are available to treat asthma? Asthma like any other condition can be treated with homeopathy at various levels. The ideal would be to find the treatment, which reflects the Similimum of the case (or as near to the Similimum as possible). By Similimum, I mean the remedy that best matches the person not just in terms of his symptoms but also in terms of his psyche and the way that he relates to other people and to life generally. This would offer a deeper prospect of healing. However finding the Similimum may not always be possible and there are many remedies which may be given for the symptoms of asthma. There are also remedies that can be given for the causes of allergic asthma (homeopathic preparations of house dust mite, grasses and pollens etc). Asthma is a condition for which I would highly recommend professional treatment – I would not advocate self-treatment. Here are the outlines of a few remedies, which may be helpful in the treatment of asthma.</strong></h2>\r\n<h2>Treat your Asthma with Homeopathy</h2>\r\nHomeopathy should be the treatment of choice for asthma and other allergies. It is safe and effective for babies through to the elderly. It is important to note that asthma is a chronic complaint best treated by a qualified homeopath. While some remedies discussed in this article will be found in many home-use kits because they can also treat a range of acute problems, the successful treatment of asthma frequently needs potencies and changes of remedies beyond the scope of a home kit and prescriber. <strong>For the best results please use the services of a fully qualified homeopath.</strong> The homeopathic remedies needed for asthma also vary according to the symptoms of the sufferer but some of the main ones are listed below.\r\n<h3>Antimonium Tartaricum (Ant-t.)</h3>\r\nKey Symptoms: Rattling breathing and wet sounding cough with mucus that is hard to cough up. Want to be fanned. Breathlessness worse for heat.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Especially useful for young children or elderly patients. Irritable and want to be left alone. Do not want to be examined or touched. Weakness. Occasional expectoration of small amounts of yellow, sticky mucus.\r\n\r\nComments: This is a remedy for many complaints that are accompanied by difficult breathing. While it can be indicated at any age it is frequently needed at the extremes of life – i.e., infancy or old age. The person may be drowsy or lethargic its. The respiration will often be rattling but there will be difficulty in coughing up the mucus that is obviously present. Breathing may become so difficult that the person can be bluish and sound as though they are about to suffocate. In severe cases heart failure may be present. Ant-t is also a remedy that can be used during cholera and chickenpox when indicated by the symptoms.\r\n\r\n<strong>Arsenicum Album (Ars.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Wheezing may be present but the cough will be dry. Asthma from cold air. Asthma worse for lying; must sit upright or bent forward to breathe.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma triggered by dampness, cold food or drinks, or watery fruit. Wheezing from allergies to cats, smoke, or dust. Thirsty for sips of warm drinks.\r\n\r\nComments: One of the most common remedies for acute asthma. The person will be restless and anxious, and symptoms are usually worse between midnight and 3 am. At times, the restlessness will lead to exhaustion. They will feel chilly and better for warmth, and feel better for sipping warm drinks. Those who need Ars. constitutionally are likely to be nervous, anxious, critical, and afraid of being alone. They are often perfectionists, have to keep things meticulously tidy, and can be hard to please. Burning sensations that feel better for warmth and often accompanied they are problems. Headaches however will be relieved by cold applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Grindelia (Grin.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Dry asthma. Wheezing may be present but the cough will be dry.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Chronic bronchitis. Rattling respiration. Expectoration of profuse sticky mucus improves asthma. Suffocating sensation on falling asleep. Sleep apnoea. Breathing improved by sitting or standing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kali Bichromicum (Kali-bi.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma with sticky or stringy mucus. Breathing better if coughing up mucous. Cough worsened by eating.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma often dissociated with bronchitis, sinusitis, or postnasal dripping. Wheezing during sleep.\r\n\r\nComments: These patients feel cold, and get sick after being chilled. Despite this, they feel worse in summer. They get mucous membrane infections, mostly in the respiratory tract. The mucous will be gluey, thick, stringy and sticky. It may start out clear and then turn white or green, and can cause ulceration. Pains can appear in many parts of the body, can migrate quickly, and can be precisely located (the patient can put a finger on the spot where the pain is). They may suffer from ulcers, including stomach ulcers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Nux Vomica (Nux-v.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Allergic asthma. Symptoms worse at 4am or on waking in the morning.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma may be a associated with digestive complaints. Asthma triggered by cold air. Asthma worsened by eating. Asthma improved by warm drinks. Asthma from overindulgence with alcohol, food, or recreational drugs.\r\n\r\nComments: The first remedy to look at for hangovers, nausea and vomiting. Patients tend to overdo both work and play. They can work long hours and then have trouble sleeping at night due to business anxieties or nervous exhaustion. They will overindulge in food, alcohol, and stimulants (especially coffee), and may regret it later – as with a hangover. They can be irritable, short tempered, nervy and do not suffer fools gladly. They are at their worst in the morning or in cold weather. They tend to be neat and tidy, and expect the same from others. Pains may be cramping and spasmodic. Their stomach may feel heavy and sensetive to pressure. They are also very sensitive to smells and light.\r\n\r\n<strong>Phosphorus (Phos.)</strong>\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma from upper respiratory tract infections (head colds) that go down to the chest. Asthma with coughing and wheezing.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: Asthma worse from lying on the left side – may improves on lying on the right side. Hoarseness with asthma. Tickling and irritating cough. Asthma from odours (even flowers) and fumes.\r\n\r\nPulsatilla Pratensis (Puls.)\r\n\r\nKey Symptoms: Asthma from allergies. Asthma worse for warm, stuffy rooms and better in the open air. Asthma with thirstlessness.\r\n\r\nSupporting Symptoms: ‘Juicy’ or green mucus with asthma. Asthma better the cold air or air conditioning. Breathing better for sitting propped up. Asthma with conjunctivitis and itchy eyes. Asthma from cats. Asthma worse at night.\r\n\r\nComments: Patients will be clingy, needy, sensitive, emotional and shy. Often they will have blue eyes and blond hair, and are likable. They can whine and be irritable, and are most often women or children. They are also very sensitive and can be hurt by even slight criticism. They may be chilly or warm-blooded, but in either case can’t stand stuffy rooms and feel better for fresh air. Discharges are bland, thick and yellow or green. Their emotions can change quickly and unexpected, as in from tears to laughter in a matter of minutes. They bend easily, and crave sympathy and attention from others, and make friends easily.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

Homeopathy has much to offer, says <i>Dr. Shreepad Khedekar MD (Hom)</i>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant cases treated by Dr. Shreepad Khedekar is the one of Miss. Ana M a young girl from Belgrade who developed Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 10 years after her father left the family and married his Argentinian girlfriend. Ana was devastated and started venting out in Art and music. She could barely walk and was brought to Dr. Shreepad Khedekar''s Belgrade clinic on a wheel chair. After a careful analysis she was prescribed the remedy CARCINOSINUM 200C and to great surprise she responded miraculously to it. So much so that she later joined the Red Star club in Belgrade as a running Athlete! She has won several medals for her club. Her case history can be requested by email on imperialclinics@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSome of the most common presentations in general practice are problems of pain in joints and muscles. Sometimes these problems are acute, as in sports injuries, sometimes they are chronic, as in osteoarthritis, and sometimes they are intermittent, as in back pain. Whatever the problem, they provide the GP with a challenge for management. Its most important to find out the main cause of these pathologies which is usually deep seated in the individual''s life experiences and mind. The homeopath must investigate in detail like a detective and then treat the cause to then cure the disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Shreepad Khedekar explains the art of curing joint problems\r\n\r\n[embed]https://youtu.be/VsnY8usANig[/embed]\r\n\r\nThe homeopath must take a careful history, examine the affected part, and make a diagnosis, possibly with the help of blood tests, x-rays or MRI scans. Having confirmed the diagnosis, the treatment option must then be decided, which should not be the prescription of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen, a local steroid injection, a referral for physiotherapy or a referral to a rheumatologist. All these unfortunately are only palliative, meaning they only reduce the pain and NEVER cure the problem from its roots.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mentioned below are some of the most commonly met joint problems:</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Back problems\r\n</b>Of course, we must always remember our homeopathic basics, so Rhus tox would only be appropriate if the modalities of stiffness after rest, pain better for heat, and relief by gradual movement were present. So when Clive, aged 41, came to see me with a 10-year history of backache, caused by jarring his spine in a diving accident, I needed to know the modalities of his pain. In his case, the pain was a lot worse on moving, and pain-free at rest and was relieved by ice-packs, so I prescribed Bryonia 200C one dose. When I next saw him, he had achieved a 90 per cent improvement, and was delighted.\r\n\r\n<b>Knee problems\r\n</b>Similarly Bob, aged 53, had a four-year history of pain in his knees, which had started after a strenuous game of golf. His pain was also worse for movement, and he had no early morning stiffness. As a person he was extremely thirsty and his thermal preference was amelioration in cold weather, I prescribed Lachesis 30c, one dose for him too. Again, after one month, he had improved enough to stop his painkillers.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving pains\r\n</b>It is always very satisfying to treat a patient successfully using homeopathy, who has puzzled the rheumatology specialists. Rochelle, aged 65, was one such case, who came to see me privately with an acute arthritis of unknown origin. When she came to me, she had severe pain in her right elbow, such that she could not even feed herself, and her left ankle and forefoot were very inflamed, making walking very painful. The joints including her elbow were very painful, such that she could not even feed herself, and her left ankle and forefoot were very inflamed, making walking very painful. The joints were swollen, but not red, very stiff in the mornings, and improved by both heat and ice-packs. The site of the affected joint flitted around, such that a week previously it had been her left shoulder and left elbow.\r\n\r\nShe was on maximum doses of ibuprofen, and also some powerful second-line anti-arthritic drugs, to no avail. In her character, she was a changeable person, describing herself as being either up or down. She was very weepy and loved consolation and cuddles. She admitted to liking to be the centre of attention and, indeed, had been an actress. She craved fresh air, was not particularly thirsty, and was averse to fatty food.\r\n\r\nThe local joint modalities were difficult to prescribe on, but her constitutional type was plainly Pulsatilla. To the amazement of her rheumatologist, within a month of taking Pulsatilla 200C, her joint pains all subsided and the swelling resolved in all but her right ankle, which had completely resolved by the second follow-up consultation.\r\n\r\n<b>Prevention better than cure\r\n</b>Equally successful was the case of Rinni, aged 28, who had developed flitting joint pains at the age of 15. Both her mother and grandmother suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and she was obviously worried that she was developing the same. So far, her blood tests for rheumatoid had been negative.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw her, the pains were worse for pressure and better for motion, with a lot of stiffness, and more comfortable in the warm weather.\r\n\r\nAs a person, she was chilly, and loved the sunshine. She described herself as an optimist, with a positive attitude to life. She was very emotional and empathetic to others; very affectionate, with a need for physical touch.\r\n\r\nOn these symptoms, I prescribed Phosphorus on a constitutional level, and this settled her symptoms very quickly. Over the years that I have been treating her, she has needed one or two doses of Phosphorus per year to keep her joint problems under control.\r\n\r\nI have a strong feeling that had she not been treated homeopathically, she might well have gone on to develop rheumatoid arthritis like her family members.\r\n\r\n<b>Severe rheumatoid arthritis\r\n</b>Obviously, prevention is better than cure, and the treatment of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis is often less dramatic. However, some help can be given with symptom control, as was the case with Miss S.G., aged 60, who came to see me with very long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, which had caused severe deformities of her hands and feet. She had had a knee replacement, and had had operations to both feet.\r\n\r\nShe had had Ayurvedic gold treatment 20 years ago, which had caused some kidney damage. By the time she came to me, her disease had more or less burnt out, but she was suffering from extreme fatigue and some residual joint pains. I treated her constitutionally with Natrum muriaticum. On this regime she managed very well over the several years that I looked after her.\r\n\r\n<b>Tennis and golfer’s elbow\r\n</b>Tennis elbow is an incapacitating condition. It is pain on the outer side of the elbow, caused not only by tennis, but also any other repetitive action that involves flexion of the forearm muscles, like cleaning windows. Golfer’s elbow is identical, but on the inner side of the elbow. It often responds extremely well to Opium (like I had prescribed for a world famous tennis coach to Jank Tipsarevic, which is a remedy that affects the insertion of tendons into the periosteum of the bones. Opium in potentised form has exactly the same modalities as Rhus tox, ie better for heat, stiffness after rest, better on gradual movement, but has different tissue affinities – tendons and periosteum rather than muscle.\r\n\r\n<b>Gout\r\n</b>Conditions such as gout can also be managed successfully using homeopathic remedies. Colchicum, the autumn crocus, has in its materia medica an exact description of the symptoms of gout ­“Inflammation of the great toe, cannot bear to have it touched or moved” (Boericke). Ledum (marsh tea) has the clinical picture of swollen, hot, pale joints, with the ball of the great toe swollen. Formica rufa (crushed live ants) is excellent for chronic gout and stiffness in the joints. The skin on the gouty joint is red, itching and burning.\r\n\r\n<b>Conditions of muscles\r\n</b>Conditions of the muscles such as fibrositis, fibromyalgia and polymyalgia rheumatica are difficult to treat conventionally. Diagnosis is often delayed and can be very difficult.\r\n\r\nFibrositis is thought to be caused by small adhesions between individual muscle fibres, causing stiffness and pain in isolated spots, “trigger points”, mainly in the back, shoulders and buttocks. The remedy Kali bichromicum fits this description well, having “pain in small spots”.\r\n\r\nFibromyalgia is very similar but involves more diffuse tenderness and pains in the muscles. Remedies such as Rhus tox, if the modalities fit, can be very useful.\r\n\r\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is a specific inflammation of the proximal muscles of the upper arms and thighs, which are very tender and weak. Climbing stairs is particularly difficult, as is raising the arms above the head to open cupboards, etc. This condition responds very well to steroids, but as the disease usually takes a couple of years to run its natural course, the steroids may have to be maintained for this length of time. To avoid the side-effects of steroids, homeopathic treatment can be tried.\r\n\r\nMrs E.C., age 48, developed pains in her upper arms and thighs, and a blood test showed she was suffering from polymyalgia rheumatica. She asked me to treat her homeopathically rather than go on steroids, so I gave her Rhus tox, which fitted her modalities well. However, after some weeks of treatment, there was very little improvement, so I gave her Psorinum, which is a nosode, useful if the well-indicated remedy fails to work. The improvement with this was dramatic, causing a rapid decrease in pain and increase in strength.\r\n\r\nHomeopathy on a constitutional basis is the most successful way of treating all these conditions, but local prescribing sometimes can be useful although I rarely use this.\r\n\r\n<b>Frozen shoulder\r\n</b>Frozen shoulder is another condition that runs a very prolonged course. It often seems to be provoked by minimal trauma, or by painful conditions of the chest wall causing lack of use of the shoulder, which then seizes up. The natural course is severe pain in the shoulder for a year, and then complete “freezing” of the joint for another year. After that the whole thing resolves spontaneously. Of course most people do not want to wait for natural resolution, and various homeopathic shoulder remedies can be useful. Kalmia latifolia (mountain laurel) is indicated for right-sided shoulder pain and Ferrum metallicum for left-sided shoulder pain.\r\n\r\n<b>Repetitive strain injury\r\n</b>Repetitive strain injury should be treated by immobilisation of the painful part for two weeks, accompanied by an appropriate remedy, such as Ruta grav. Obviously it is important to modify the behaviour that caused the problem in the first place, by paying attention to posture and hand positioning at a keyboard, for example.\r\n\r\nThis article by no means comprehensively covers the whole field of joint and muscle problems but hopefully gives a flavour of what homeopathy can do in this area. I do not want to give the impression that homeopathy is a miracle cure in all such cases, and indeed some patients fail to respond to apparently well-indicated remedies. A lot of improvement can be achieved by homeopathic self-help, but more complicated problems will need to be managed by a homeopathic practitioner.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h1 class="entry-title">Arthritis and Rheumatism</h1>\r\n</header>\r\n<div class="entry-content">\r\n\r\n<b><i>Dr. Shreepad Khedekar MD (Hom) </i> discusses his approach to this common, painful and potentially crippling group of conditions</b>\r\n\r\nArthritis and rheumatism are among the commonest forms of chronic disease and, with an aging population, are set to become commoner still. Strictly speaking, arthritis means disease of the joints, while rheumatism is disease of the soft connective tissues which support and move the joints. In fact, the distinction is often artificial, since many of these conditions affect both the joints and connective tissues.\r\n\r\nOsteoarthritis, the commonest of these conditions, is basically “wear and tear” of the joints. The root of the problem is wearing out of the cartilage, the tough, slippery “gristle”, which allows the ends of the bone to slide smoothly over each other and absorbs shocks. The joint becomes stiff and painful, and may creak as it is moved.\r\n\r\nAs the cartilage wears down, the bones on either side of the joint may react by forming small bony outgrowths called osteophytes. One of the sites where bony nodes can easily be seen is the last joint of the fingers. Spondylosis is a similar problem affecting the spine; here the main problem is degeneration of the disks which separate the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect with a degenerative condition the prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age, it affects nine per cent of the total population but around 70 per cent of the over-70s. It is the commonest of all rheumatological conditions, and indeed probably the commonest of all chronic diseases, because many sufferers live with it for many years. Not surprisingly it tends to affect weight-bearing joints (eg low back, hips and knees). Joint injuries or overuse (for instance heavy physical work or professional sport) predispose to osteoarthritis later in life. Overweight is another important factor.\r\n\r\nThe other two main groups of arthritis and rheumatism are inflammatory arthritis, of which the commonest form is rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue rheumatism. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about one person in a hundred; it is nearly three times commoner in women than men (for unknown reasons). Its cause, too, remains frustratingly elusive. It tends to come on at an earlier age than osteoarthritis (typically in the 30s to 50s) and is more aggressive, running a more rapid course: about a third of sufferers are seriously disabled within ten years, although it is very variable. It particularly affects the small joints, especially of the hands and feet, causing a typical hand deformity where the fingers slant sideways. But it can affect almost any joint in the body, and also cause nodules under the skin and eye problems. There are many other forms of inflammatory arthritis, some of them associated with infections.\r\n\r\nThe final group is true rheumatism, affecting the soft connective tissues rather then the joints themselves. There are many forms, some with picturesque names. They include enthesopathies which affect the point at which tendons connect to the bones – the best known of these are tennis elbow, affecting the outer side of the elbow, and golfer’s elbow, which affects the inner side. Capsulitis – inflammation of the capsule of tissues that surround the joint – most commonly affects the shoulder, and may lead to a stiff “frozen” shoulder. Some of the more amusing names are reserved for bursitis – inflammation of the bursae, cushioning pads which overlie many joints. These include Housemaid’s Knee (also known as Clergyman’s Knee), from too much kneeling. But my favourite is Weaver’s Bottom – so called because it used to affect weavers who had to shuffle up and down long benches to tend their looms!\r\n\r\nThe most common form of soft tissue rheumatism, however, is fibromyalgia (which used to be known as fibrositis). It affects about two per cent of people and is much commoner in women than men. It is a controversial condition; some believe that fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME) are varieties of the same condition, certainly there are similarities. The typical features are widespread musculoskeletal pain and aching with tender points at several specific locations. It is frequently associated with poor sleep and fatigue as well as other problems including migraine and irritable bowel syndrome.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems with current conventional treatment of arthritis and rheumatism. For instance, although osteoarthritis rarely, if ever, killed anyone, a group of drugs often used in its treatment, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including aspirin, Ibuprofen and Voltarol among many others, certainly has. There are some 12,000 hospital admissions and 2,000 deaths from these drugs every year in the Mumbai alone. Although the new generation of NSAIDs is safer, they are only glorified painkillers, which do not affect the basic disease process. Similarly for rheumatoid arthritis, a range of powerful drugs is available but all of these have long and alarming lists of side effects. Mostly cytostatic used in Cancer management are used and they have deadly side-effects.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first.

Homeopathy has much to offer, says <i>Dr. Shreepad Khedekar MD (Hom)</i>\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant cases treated by Dr. Shreepad Khedekar is the one of Miss. Ana M a young girl from Belgrade who developed Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 10 years after her father left the family and married his Argentinian girlfriend. Ana was devastated and started venting out in Art and music. She could barely walk and was brought to Dr. Shreepad Khedekar''s Belgrade clinic on a wheel chair. After a careful analysis she was prescribed the remedy CARCINOSINUM 200C and to great surprise she responded miraculously to it. So much so that she later joined the Red Star club in Belgrade as a running Athlete! She has won several medals for her club. Her case history can be requested by email on imperialclinics@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSome of the most common presentations in general practice are problems of pain in joints and muscles. Sometimes these problems are acute, as in sports injuries, sometimes they are chronic, as in osteoarthritis, and sometimes they are intermittent, as in back pain. Whatever the problem, they provide the GP with a challenge for management. Its most important to find out the main cause of these pathologies which is usually deep seated in the individual''s life experiences and mind. The homeopath must investigate in detail like a detective and then treat the cause to then cure the disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Shreepad Khedekar explains the art of curing joint problems\r\n\r\n[embed]https://youtu.be/VsnY8usANig[/embed]\r\n\r\nThe homeopath must take a careful history, examine the affected part, and make a diagnosis, possibly with the help of blood tests, x-rays or MRI scans. Having confirmed the diagnosis, the treatment option must then be decided, which should not be the prescription of an anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen, a local steroid injection, a referral for physiotherapy or a referral to a rheumatologist. All these unfortunately are only palliative, meaning they only reduce the pain and NEVER cure the problem from its roots.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mentioned below are some of the most commonly met joint problems:</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Back problems\r\n</b>Of course, we must always remember our homeopathic basics, so Rhus tox would only be appropriate if the modalities of stiffness after rest, pain better for heat, and relief by gradual movement were present. So when Clive, aged 41, came to see me with a 10-year history of backache, caused by jarring his spine in a diving accident, I needed to know the modalities of his pain. In his case, the pain was a lot worse on moving, and pain-free at rest and was relieved by ice-packs, so I prescribed Bryonia 200C one dose. When I next saw him, he had achieved a 90 per cent improvement, and was delighted.\r\n\r\n<b>Knee problems\r\n</b>Similarly Bob, aged 53, had a four-year history of pain in his knees, which had started after a strenuous game of golf. His pain was also worse for movement, and he had no early morning stiffness. As a person he was extremely thirsty and his thermal preference was amelioration in cold weather, I prescribed Lachesis 30c, one dose for him too. Again, after one month, he had improved enough to stop his painkillers.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving pains\r\n</b>It is always very satisfying to treat a patient successfully using homeopathy, who has puzzled the rheumatology specialists. Rochelle, aged 65, was one such case, who came to see me privately with an acute arthritis of unknown origin. When she came to me, she had severe pain in her right elbow, such that she could not even feed herself, and her left ankle and forefoot were very inflamed, making walking very painful. The joints including her elbow were very painful, such that she could not even feed herself, and her left ankle and forefoot were very inflamed, making walking very painful. The joints were swollen, but not red, very stiff in the mornings, and improved by both heat and ice-packs. The site of the affected joint flitted around, such that a week previously it had been her left shoulder and left elbow.\r\n\r\nShe was on maximum doses of ibuprofen, and also some powerful second-line anti-arthritic drugs, to no avail. In her character, she was a changeable person, describing herself as being either up or down. She was very weepy and loved consolation and cuddles. She admitted to liking to be the centre of attention and, indeed, had been an actress. She craved fresh air, was not particularly thirsty, and was averse to fatty food.\r\n\r\nThe local joint modalities were difficult to prescribe on, but her constitutional type was plainly Pulsatilla. To the amazement of her rheumatologist, within a month of taking Pulsatilla 200C, her joint pains all subsided and the swelling resolved in all but her right ankle, which had completely resolved by the second follow-up consultation.\r\n\r\n<b>Prevention better than cure\r\n</b>Equally successful was the case of Rinni, aged 28, who had developed flitting joint pains at the age of 15. Both her mother and grandmother suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and she was obviously worried that she was developing the same. So far, her blood tests for rheumatoid had been negative.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw her, the pains were worse for pressure and better for motion, with a lot of stiffness, and more comfortable in the warm weather.\r\n\r\nAs a person, she was chilly, and loved the sunshine. She described herself as an optimist, with a positive attitude to life. She was very emotional and empathetic to others; very affectionate, with a need for physical touch.\r\n\r\nOn these symptoms, I prescribed Phosphorus on a constitutional level, and this settled her symptoms very quickly. Over the years that I have been treating her, she has needed one or two doses of Phosphorus per year to keep her joint problems under control.\r\n\r\nI have a strong feeling that had she not been treated homeopathically, she might well have gone on to develop rheumatoid arthritis like her family members.\r\n\r\n<b>Severe rheumatoid arthritis\r\n</b>Obviously, prevention is better than cure, and the treatment of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis is often less dramatic. However, some help can be given with symptom control, as was the case with Miss S.G., aged 60, who came to see me with very long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, which had caused severe deformities of her hands and feet. She had had a knee replacement, and had had operations to both feet.\r\n\r\nShe had had Ayurvedic gold treatment 20 years ago, which had caused some kidney damage. By the time she came to me, her disease had more or less burnt out, but she was suffering from extreme fatigue and some residual joint pains. I treated her constitutionally with Natrum muriaticum. On this regime she managed very well over the several years that I looked after her.\r\n\r\n<b>Tennis and golfer’s elbow\r\n</b>Tennis elbow is an incapacitating condition. It is pain on the outer side of the elbow, caused not only by tennis, but also any other repetitive action that involves flexion of the forearm muscles, like cleaning windows. Golfer’s elbow is identical, but on the inner side of the elbow. It often responds extremely well to Opium (like I had prescribed for a world famous tennis coach to Jank Tipsarevic, which is a remedy that affects the insertion of tendons into the periosteum of the bones. Opium in potentised form has exactly the same modalities as Rhus tox, ie better for heat, stiffness after rest, better on gradual movement, but has different tissue affinities – tendons and periosteum rather than muscle.\r\n\r\n<b>Gout\r\n</b>Conditions such as gout can also be managed successfully using homeopathic remedies. Colchicum, the autumn crocus, has in its materia medica an exact description of the symptoms of gout ­“Inflammation of the great toe, cannot bear to have it touched or moved” (Boericke). Ledum (marsh tea) has the clinical picture of swollen, hot, pale joints, with the ball of the great toe swollen. Formica rufa (crushed live ants) is excellent for chronic gout and stiffness in the joints. The skin on the gouty joint is red, itching and burning.\r\n\r\n<b>Conditions of muscles\r\n</b>Conditions of the muscles such as fibrositis, fibromyalgia and polymyalgia rheumatica are difficult to treat conventionally. Diagnosis is often delayed and can be very difficult.\r\n\r\nFibrositis is thought to be caused by small adhesions between individual muscle fibres, causing stiffness and pain in isolated spots, “trigger points”, mainly in the back, shoulders and buttocks. The remedy Kali bichromicum fits this description well, having “pain in small spots”.\r\n\r\nFibromyalgia is very similar but involves more diffuse tenderness and pains in the muscles. Remedies such as Rhus tox, if the modalities fit, can be very useful.\r\n\r\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is a specific inflammation of the proximal muscles of the upper arms and thighs, which are very tender and weak. Climbing stairs is particularly difficult, as is raising the arms above the head to open cupboards, etc. This condition responds very well to steroids, but as the disease usually takes a couple of years to run its natural course, the steroids may have to be maintained for this length of time. To avoid the side-effects of steroids, homeopathic treatment can be tried.\r\n\r\nMrs E.C., age 48, developed pains in her upper arms and thighs, and a blood test showed she was suffering from polymyalgia rheumatica. She asked me to treat her homeopathically rather than go on steroids, so I gave her Rhus tox, which fitted her modalities well. However, after some weeks of treatment, there was very little improvement, so I gave her Psorinum, which is a nosode, useful if the well-indicated remedy fails to work. The improvement with this was dramatic, causing a rapid decrease in pain and increase in strength.\r\n\r\nHomeopathy on a constitutional basis is the most successful way of treating all these conditions, but local prescribing sometimes can be useful although I rarely use this.\r\n\r\n<b>Frozen shoulder\r\n</b>Frozen shoulder is another condition that runs a very prolonged course. It often seems to be provoked by minimal trauma, or by painful conditions of the chest wall causing lack of use of the shoulder, which then seizes up. The natural course is severe pain in the shoulder for a year, and then complete “freezing” of the joint for another year. After that the whole thing resolves spontaneously. Of course most people do not want to wait for natural resolution, and various homeopathic shoulder remedies can be useful. Kalmia latifolia (mountain laurel) is indicated for right-sided shoulder pain and Ferrum metallicum for left-sided shoulder pain.\r\n\r\n<b>Repetitive strain injury\r\n</b>Repetitive strain injury should be treated by immobilisation of the painful part for two weeks, accompanied by an appropriate remedy, such as Ruta grav. Obviously it is important to modify the behaviour that caused the problem in the first place, by paying attention to posture and hand positioning at a keyboard, for example.\r\n\r\nThis article by no means comprehensively covers the whole field of joint and muscle problems but hopefully gives a flavour of what homeopathy can do in this area. I do not want to give the impression that homeopathy is a miracle cure in all such cases, and indeed some patients fail to respond to apparently well-indicated remedies. A lot of improvement can be achieved by homeopathic self-help, but more complicated problems will need to be managed by a homeopathic practitioner.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h1 class="entry-title">Arthritis and Rheumatism</h1>\r\n</header>\r\n<div class="entry-content">\r\n\r\n<b><i>Dr. Shreepad Khedekar MD (Hom) </i> discusses his approach to this common, painful and potentially crippling group of conditions</b>\r\n\r\nArthritis and rheumatism are among the commonest forms of chronic disease and, with an aging population, are set to become commoner still. Strictly speaking, arthritis means disease of the joints, while rheumatism is disease of the soft connective tissues which support and move the joints. In fact, the distinction is often artificial, since many of these conditions affect both the joints and connective tissues.\r\n\r\nOsteoarthritis, the commonest of these conditions, is basically “wear and tear” of the joints. The root of the problem is wearing out of the cartilage, the tough, slippery “gristle”, which allows the ends of the bone to slide smoothly over each other and absorbs shocks. The joint becomes stiff and painful, and may creak as it is moved.\r\n\r\nAs the cartilage wears down, the bones on either side of the joint may react by forming small bony outgrowths called osteophytes. One of the sites where bony nodes can easily be seen is the last joint of the fingers. Spondylosis is a similar problem affecting the spine; here the main problem is degeneration of the disks which separate the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect with a degenerative condition the prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age, it affects nine per cent of the total population but around 70 per cent of the over-70s. It is the commonest of all rheumatological conditions, and indeed probably the commonest of all chronic diseases, because many sufferers live with it for many years. Not surprisingly it tends to affect weight-bearing joints (eg low back, hips and knees). Joint injuries or overuse (for instance heavy physical work or professional sport) predispose to osteoarthritis later in life. Overweight is another important factor.\r\n\r\nThe other two main groups of arthritis and rheumatism are inflammatory arthritis, of which the commonest form is rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue rheumatism. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about one person in a hundred; it is nearly three times commoner in women than men (for unknown reasons). Its cause, too, remains frustratingly elusive. It tends to come on at an earlier age than osteoarthritis (typically in the 30s to 50s) and is more aggressive, running a more rapid course: about a third of sufferers are seriously disabled within ten years, although it is very variable. It particularly affects the small joints, especially of the hands and feet, causing a typical hand deformity where the fingers slant sideways. But it can affect almost any joint in the body, and also cause nodules under the skin and eye problems. There are many other forms of inflammatory arthritis, some of them associated with infections.\r\n\r\nThe final group is true rheumatism, affecting the soft connective tissues rather then the joints themselves. There are many forms, some with picturesque names. They include enthesopathies which affect the point at which tendons connect to the bones – the best known of these are tennis elbow, affecting the outer side of the elbow, and golfer’s elbow, which affects the inner side. Capsulitis – inflammation of the capsule of tissues that surround the joint – most commonly affects the shoulder, and may lead to a stiff “frozen” shoulder. Some of the more amusing names are reserved for bursitis – inflammation of the bursae, cushioning pads which overlie many joints. These include Housemaid’s Knee (also known as Clergyman’s Knee), from too much kneeling. But my favourite is Weaver’s Bottom – so called because it used to affect weavers who had to shuffle up and down long benches to tend their looms!\r\n\r\nThe most common form of soft tissue rheumatism, however, is fibromyalgia (which used to be known as fibrositis). It affects about two per cent of people and is much commoner in women than men. It is a controversial condition; some believe that fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME) are varieties of the same condition, certainly there are similarities. The typical features are widespread musculoskeletal pain and aching with tender points at several specific locations. It is frequently associated with poor sleep and fatigue as well as other problems including migraine and irritable bowel syndrome.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems with current conventional treatment of arthritis and rheumatism. For instance, although osteoarthritis rarely, if ever, killed anyone, a group of drugs often used in its treatment, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including aspirin, Ibuprofen and Voltarol among many others, certainly has. There are some 12,000 hospital admissions and 2,000 deaths from these drugs every year in the Mumbai alone. Although the new generation of NSAIDs is safer, they are only glorified painkillers, which do not affect the basic disease process. Similarly for rheumatoid arthritis, a range of powerful drugs is available but all of these have long and alarming lists of side effects. Mostly cytostatic used in Cancer management are used and they have deadly side-effects.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

These figures are not so surprising when we enumerate the skin’s many functions. Some are fairly obvious: protection against chemicals, radiation, microbes etc; preserving a balanced internal environment by keeping us warm, preventing us from drying out; and the sensation of touch in all its variety. But the skin has less obvious functions: subcutaneous fat is a major reserve of energy, vitamin D is synthesised in the skin when exposed to ultra-violet light. The skin also has important social and sexual functions: it secretes pheromones which play an important role in sexual attraction, while the hair and lips play a more conscious social and sexual role.\r\n\r\nThe skin has two main parts: the superficial epidermis whose thickness ranges from 0.1mm on the eyelids to 1mm on the soles of the feet. The epidermis contains no blood vessels, its most superficial layer is the dead, dry horny layer which is constantly shed, contributing to the dust in our homes. The dermis lies beneath the epidermis supporting and nourishing it and providing immunity and other functions.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, skin problems are common: surveys suggest that 20-30 per cent of us have a skin problem which deserves medical attention, but that most of us do not see doctors about them, preferring to treat them ourselves. Skin problems are among the commonest reasons for which people, especially children, seek homeopathic treatment. Of course, as always with homeopathy, it is important to be sure that homeopathic treatment is appropriate – it is for many forms of skin disease, but there are important exceptions. The most conspicuous is malignant melanoma. This is an aggressive form of skin cancer whose incidence is increasing (although fortunately it remains rare) because of greater sun exposure and thinning of the ozone layer. The warning signs are a “mole”, which grows, bleeds or is irregular in shape or colour. It is better to be safe than sorry, and have any such skin lesion removed surgically.\r\n\r\nDr. Shreepad Khedekar''s interview on National TV (Marathi)\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/n688itBPzLU\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/MbCrO8WdiiY\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QveC4R5BTLc\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A6wqHLdsZNk\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/N8IVHG5LscU\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/NxhieO5Ljcg\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XNUf7fFmBQI\r\n\r\n<b>Homeopathy treatment for Eczema and Eczema homeopathic medicine\r\n</b>Also known as dermatitis, eczema is among the commonest forms of skin disease, and it often responds well to homeopathic treatment. It affects up to 20 per cent of schoolchildren and seven to eight percent of adults. Children tend to grow out of it and the majority improve greatly by their mid-teens. It is an inflammatory condition in which patches of skin become red, inflamed and itchy. The affected areas may also be covered in small, fluid-filled blisters. There are a number of different forms of eczema.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form is atopic eczema, an inborn condition which usually starts before the age of two, and may continue to flare up throughout adolescence and adulthood. “Atopy” means an inherited tendency to allergies, including eczema, asthma and hay fever. It runs in families and is getting commoner for reasons that are not entirely clear. A currently popular theory, known as the “hygiene hypothesis” suggests the reason is basically that kids today are too clean (try telling that to the mother of an average eight year-old boy!). It is based on the observation that children who grow up on farms and the younger children of large families are less likely to be atopic. The theory is that such children are more likely to be exposed to certain kinds of bacteria and that this stimulates their immune systems to mature. But not all the scientific evidence agrees on this and the jury is still out.\r\n\r\nContact dermatitis is caused by contact with a substance to which an individual is sensitive, such as nickel, rubber or various plants. It can occur at any age. Nickel is one of the commonest skin sensitisers – it can usually be spotted by the areas it affects: earrings and jean buttons often contain nickel.\r\n\r\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis occurs in adult and infantile forms. In babies it is often known as cradle cap because it affects the scalp, although it may also affect the nappy area. The adult form usually affects the face and scalp.\r\n\r\nFinally varicose eczema occurs mostly in older people, as the name suggests it is often linked to varicose veins: the blood stagnates in the lower legs resulting in a poor supply of oxygen and nutrients. The skin becomes dark, itchy and inflamed. If left untreated the skin may break down, forming an ulcer.\r\n\r\n<b>Psoriasis treatment in homeopathy and homoeopathic medicine for psoriasis\r\n</b>This too comes in several varieties, but all involve reddened areas of skin covered in large, adherent silvery scales. The basic problem is excessively rapid division of the horny cells of the epidermis, probably provoked by inflammation whose cause is currently unknown. Psoriasis tends to run in families; it most commonly comes on in late teenage or early adult life. It can be triggered by some medicines, including antidepressant, antihypertensive and antimalarial drugs, and infections with streptococcus bacteria.\r\n\r\n<b>The main types of psoriasis are: </b>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Plaque psoriasis: the patches appear typically on the knees, elbows, lower back and scalp. Unlike eczema, the patches often appear on the extensor (outer) sides of knees and elbows. The nails may develop small pits, or more serious deformity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Guttate psoriasis, where the patches are scattered, small and roundish, may follow a streptococcal infection, typically a severe sore throat.</li>\r\n 	<li>Pustular psoriasis, a severe but rare type affecting mostly the palms and soles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Homeopathic treatment\r\n</b>From the point of view of prescribing homeopathic treatment, eczema and psoriasis can be considered together. They nicely illustrate some of the principles of homeopathy: one of three homeopathic medicines will help in many cases, but the treatment must be individualised if it is to succeed. The three medicines are: Arsenicum album, Graphites and Sulphur. Homeopathy is holistic: to treat a skin problem, one has to look at the whole person, not just at their skin.\r\n\r\nTraditionally we homeopaths classify the “whole” in three parts: the “locals” (in the case of a skin problem this means the characteristics of the skin problem), “mentals” (including the personality and psychological features of the person) and the “generals” (physical features of the person as a whole). In terms of skin symptoms Arsenicum album and Sulphur are quite similar: intensely itchy rashes which burn after scratching. Rashes likely to respond to Arsenicum tend to be in small, roundish patches and flakey, while those which respond to Sulphur typically occur in large, red areas, but these distinctions are often not clear-cut and it is often difficult to be sure which medicine is indicated on the basis of the “locals” alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are marked differences in the types of people who respond to these medicines: the typical Arsenicum patient is tidy, fastidious, rather anxious (mentals) and feels the cold excessively (generals). Sulphur patients are the very opposite: often untidy, they tend to be extroverts who relish a good argument (mentals). They are often warm-blooded (feel the heat) and particularly have hot feet (generals). But having said that, one has to be flexible.\r\n\r\nGraphites cases can often be recognised by the character of the rash alone: it tends to crack, and ooze clear or yellowish, sticky liquid when scratched. The rash often affects particular areas such as behind the ears or nipples, in women the eczema may get worse around the monthly period; while the mentals and generals may not be particularly marked.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other important medicines for psoriasis and eczema: the deep acting “constitutional” (whole person) medicines include – apart from Arsenicum album, Graphites and Sulphur – Arsenicum iodatum, Lycopodium and Sepia. The two Arsenicums are typically used for guttate psoriasis: the plaques tend to be small, rounded and flakey. Arsenicum album may also be very helpful in pustular psoriasis. Arsenicum iodatum has less of the constitutional features of Arsenicum album and even may be positively hot-blooded, but these patients frequently also have severe hayfever and other allergies, affecting the eyes particularly.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Graphites, local characteristics of skin problems which respond to Lycopodium and Sepia are not very specific and these medicines are prescribed mostly on the basis of the mental and general features. The type of person who typically responds to Lycopodium clavatum is reserved or shy, and there may be underlying anxiety or depression. They frequently have stomach problems. Odd but characteristic features include a sweet tooth and a bad period in late afternoon, feeling better later. It can be useful for a range of skin problems including psoriasis and acne.\r\n\r\nSepia officinalis is most often indicated for women. Typically the patient is emotionally flat, fed-up and snappy with her family and partner. She resents others prying (as she sees it) into her problems and may hide her feelings. Often, as with Graphites, the problem seems to have come on following some event of a woman’s reproductive cycle, such as the start of a girl’s periods, childbirth and menopause. There is usually loss of sex-drive. An odd feature is the temporary improvement from exercise (dancing, working out). Again it may be useful for many skin problems including psoriasis and eczema.\r\n\r\nHowever constitutional homeopathy is not the only kind of homeopathy and unless one of the “pictures” described above really seems to fit, is perhaps best left to a practitioner. There are a number of “small” homeopathic medicines which work well prescribed on characteristic symptoms, sometimes called “keynotes”. These include Petroleum (made from crude oil). The keynote for this medicine is the marked deterioration in winter. It is very useful for children who get thick cracked skin of the knuckles in winter. Many patients helped by this medicine have told me that, although they have been prescribed steroid creams, they find Vaseline just as effective and use it rather than steroids. Vaseline is, of course, made from Petroleum! A favourite medicine of mine for gardeners’ contact dermatitis is Rhus venenata. Typically these are keen gardeners who get a very itchy, blistery rash, presumably from contact with a plant, although it is usually difficult to work out which one. The keynote here is that the only thing that relieves the itching is bathing the hands in very hot water.\r\n\r\n<b>Acne\r\n</b>Most teenagers have some acne and it can cause great emotional distress at an age when many are very self-conscious; it is much less common in other age groups. Linked to androgens, male sex hormones, that are present in both boys and girls, acne vulgaris, as this type is known, affects particularly the face but may also appear on other areas, especially the upper back, chest, shoulders and neck. It is caused by the overproduction of a natural grease called sebum, which is secreted by glands in the skin. Sebum normally drains into the hair follicles and flows out through the follicle openings on the skin surface, lubricating the skin and keeping it supple. But in acne, excess sebum blocks the follicles by hardening into plugs. Bacteria multiply in the blocked follicles, causing the surrounding tissue to become inflamed.\r\n\r\nLess common forms of acne include occupational acne, which may result from exposure to certain industrial oils; and drug-induced acne, often caused by steroids. Rosacea is a related condition occurring most often in middle aged women. The main problem is dilatation and instability of the blood vessels. It does not usually cause black- or white-heads.\r\n\r\n<b>Homeopathic treatment\r\n</b>Two of the most commonly indicated homeopathic medicines are Sulphur and Silica. And again it is illuminating to compare and contrast the local, mental and general features. We looked at the Sulphur type before. The main local feature of acne which responds to Silica is that the pustules never seem to discharge: they sit under the skin for weeks without bursting, often forming cysts. The Silica constitutional type is very different from the Sulphur, like the Arsenicum type they are usually chilly and feel cold even in a warm room. They tend to be pale and thin, with fine hair and weak, ridged nails. They will often mention that their hair has changed, becoming finer and falling out since they have been ill. Their hands and feet are cold yet clammy. Mentally they complain of feeling tired and washed out and yet are stubborn and “niggly” even sometimes obsessional.\r\n\r\nPulsatilla is another medicine which may be very helpful in acne, particularly (but by no means exclusively) in girls when crops of spots develop in the premenstrual period. It is prescribed mostly on constitutional grounds – the characteristics of the person rather than the name of the disease. Typically Pulsatilla types are mild tempered or sweet-natured, and indecisive. They are often weepy, crying when they talk about their problems, but quickly cheered up by a few reassuring words (unlike Sepia patients who may also be weepy when talking about their problems, but they resent probing and discussion – the best thing is to move on to another topic). Strangely, although the Pulsatilla type easily feels cold, she likes fresh air (provided she is well wrapped up) and hates stuffy atmospheres.\r\n\r\nOther medicines which may help in acne include Kalium bromatum; with this medicine the sufferer complains of poor sleep, often disturbed by bad dreams. They may be mentally slow, have difficulties with memory and thinking and be fidgety. Calcarea sulphurica has large yellow pustules which are slow to heal, as with Sulphur they may be itchy. Acne spots which respond to Hepar sulph are very sensitive to touch or painful as they erupt.\r\n\r\nLachesis is the most commonly indicated homeopathic medicine for rosacea. Typically the rash is dusky red and worse in hot atmospheres. The onset may be associated with the menopause, but if before the menopause, it usually gets worse before the period and eases quite abruptly when the bleeding actually starts. The typical Lachesis patient is talkative and may be suspicious or jealous. An odd symptom is that they hate tight clothes, especially round their necks – polo necks, scarves etc.\r\n\r\nAs usual with homeopathy, individualisation of treatment needs a skilled practitioner. However, I am against being too precious about this: the use of a homeopathic complex consisting of several of the homeopathic medicines most likely to be indicated is often helpful and very unlikely to do any harm. The most commonly used “complex” for acne, well worth a try if a good homeopath is not available, is Sulphur, Silica and Carbo vegetabilis, combined in a single pill often known as SSC.\r\n\r\n<b>Dose\r\n</b>As a general rule, all these medicines should be started in a dose of two pills of the 6c dilution, twice daily. “Aggravations” – a temporary flare-up of the problem at the beginning of treatment – are quite common with homeopathic treatment of skin problems. They are generally considered a good sign, indicating the treatment is provoking a reaction. If you get an aggravation you should stop treatment until it has completely settled down, don’t be in a rush to restart. You may get another aggravation on restarting, but normally it will be less severe and will die out altogether after three or four stop-start cycles. In terms of creams and other topical applications, Calendula (marigold) cream is often used by homeopaths for eczema, it has a gentle soothing action. It is often helpful in “weaning off” steroid creams, gradually substituting Calendula for them.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

These figures are not so surprising when we enumerate the skin’s many functions. Some are fairly obvious: protection against chemicals, radiation, microbes etc; preserving a balanced internal environment by keeping us warm, preventing us from drying out; and the sensation of touch in all its variety. But the skin has less obvious functions: subcutaneous fat is a major reserve of energy, vitamin D is synthesised in the skin when exposed to ultra-violet light. The skin also has important social and sexual functions: it secretes pheromones which play an important role in sexual attraction, while the hair and lips play a more conscious social and sexual role.\r\n\r\nThe skin has two main parts: the superficial epidermis whose thickness ranges from 0.1mm on the eyelids to 1mm on the soles of the feet. The epidermis contains no blood vessels, its most superficial layer is the dead, dry horny layer which is constantly shed, contributing to the dust in our homes. The dermis lies beneath the epidermis supporting and nourishing it and providing immunity and other functions.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, skin problems are common: surveys suggest that 20-30 per cent of us have a skin problem which deserves medical attention, but that most of us do not see doctors about them, preferring to treat them ourselves. Skin problems are among the commonest reasons for which people, especially children, seek homeopathic treatment. Of course, as always with homeopathy, it is important to be sure that homeopathic treatment is appropriate – it is for many forms of skin disease, but there are important exceptions. The most conspicuous is malignant melanoma. This is an aggressive form of skin cancer whose incidence is increasing (although fortunately it remains rare) because of greater sun exposure and thinning of the ozone layer. The warning signs are a “mole”, which grows, bleeds or is irregular in shape or colour. It is better to be safe than sorry, and have any such skin lesion removed surgically.\r\n\r\nDr. Shreepad Khedekar''s interview on National TV (Marathi)\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/n688itBPzLU\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/MbCrO8WdiiY\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QveC4R5BTLc\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A6wqHLdsZNk\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/N8IVHG5LscU\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/NxhieO5Ljcg\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XNUf7fFmBQI\r\n\r\n<b>Homeopathy treatment for Eczema and Eczema homeopathic medicine\r\n</b>Also known as dermatitis, eczema is among the commonest forms of skin disease, and it often responds well to homeopathic treatment. It affects up to 20 per cent of schoolchildren and seven to eight percent of adults. Children tend to grow out of it and the majority improve greatly by their mid-teens. It is an inflammatory condition in which patches of skin become red, inflamed and itchy. The affected areas may also be covered in small, fluid-filled blisters. There are a number of different forms of eczema.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form is atopic eczema, an inborn condition which usually starts before the age of two, and may continue to flare up throughout adolescence and adulthood. “Atopy” means an inherited tendency to allergies, including eczema, asthma and hay fever. It runs in families and is getting commoner for reasons that are not entirely clear. A currently popular theory, known as the “hygiene hypothesis” suggests the reason is basically that kids today are too clean (try telling that to the mother of an average eight year-old boy!). It is based on the observation that children who grow up on farms and the younger children of large families are less likely to be atopic. The theory is that such children are more likely to be exposed to certain kinds of bacteria and that this stimulates their immune systems to mature. But not all the scientific evidence agrees on this and the jury is still out.\r\n\r\nContact dermatitis is caused by contact with a substance to which an individual is sensitive, such as nickel, rubber or various plants. It can occur at any age. Nickel is one of the commonest skin sensitisers – it can usually be spotted by the areas it affects: earrings and jean buttons often contain nickel.\r\n\r\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis occurs in adult and infantile forms. In babies it is often known as cradle cap because it affects the scalp, although it may also affect the nappy area. The adult form usually affects the face and scalp.\r\n\r\nFinally varicose eczema occurs mostly in older people, as the name suggests it is often linked to varicose veins: the blood stagnates in the lower legs resulting in a poor supply of oxygen and nutrients. The skin becomes dark, itchy and inflamed. If left untreated the skin may break down, forming an ulcer.\r\n\r\n<b>Psoriasis treatment in homeopathy and homoeopathic medicine for psoriasis\r\n</b>This too comes in several varieties, but all involve reddened areas of skin covered in large, adherent silvery scales. The basic problem is excessively rapid division of the horny cells of the epidermis, probably provoked by inflammation whose cause is currently unknown. Psoriasis tends to run in families; it most commonly comes on in late teenage or early adult life. It can be triggered by some medicines, including antidepressant, antihypertensive and antimalarial drugs, and infections with streptococcus bacteria.\r\n\r\n<b>The main types of psoriasis are: </b>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Plaque psoriasis: the patches appear typically on the knees, elbows, lower back and scalp. Unlike eczema, the patches often appear on the extensor (outer) sides of knees and elbows. The nails may develop small pits, or more serious deformity.</li>\r\n 	<li>Guttate psoriasis, where the patches are scattered, small and roundish, may follow a streptococcal infection, typically a severe sore throat.</li>\r\n 	<li>Pustular psoriasis, a severe but rare type affecting mostly the palms and soles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Homeopathic treatment\r\n</b>From the point of view of prescribing homeopathic treatment, eczema and psoriasis can be considered together. They nicely illustrate some of the principles of homeopathy: one of three homeopathic medicines will help in many cases, but the treatment must be individualised if it is to succeed. The three medicines are: Arsenicum album, Graphites and Sulphur. Homeopathy is holistic: to treat a skin problem, one has to look at the whole person, not just at their skin.\r\n\r\nTraditionally we homeopaths classify the “whole” in three parts: the “locals” (in the case of a skin problem this means the characteristics of the skin problem), “mentals” (including the personality and psychological features of the person) and the “generals” (physical features of the person as a whole). In terms of skin symptoms Arsenicum album and Sulphur are quite similar: intensely itchy rashes which burn after scratching. Rashes likely to respond to Arsenicum tend to be in small, roundish patches and flakey, while those which respond to Sulphur typically occur in large, red areas, but these distinctions are often not clear-cut and it is often difficult to be sure which medicine is indicated on the basis of the “locals” alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are marked differences in the types of people who respond to these medicines: the typical Arsenicum patient is tidy, fastidious, rather anxious (mentals) and feels the cold excessively (generals). Sulphur patients are the very opposite: often untidy, they tend to be extroverts who relish a good argument (mentals). They are often warm-blooded (feel the heat) and particularly have hot feet (generals). But having said that, one has to be flexible.\r\n\r\nGraphites cases can often be recognised by the character of the rash alone: it tends to crack, and ooze clear or yellowish, sticky liquid when scratched. The rash often affects particular areas such as behind the ears or nipples, in women the eczema may get worse around the monthly period; while the mentals and generals may not be particularly marked.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other important medicines for psoriasis and eczema: the deep acting “constitutional” (whole person) medicines include – apart from Arsenicum album, Graphites and Sulphur – Arsenicum iodatum, Lycopodium and Sepia. The two Arsenicums are typically used for guttate psoriasis: the plaques tend to be small, rounded and flakey. Arsenicum album may also be very helpful in pustular psoriasis. Arsenicum iodatum has less of the constitutional features of Arsenicum album and even may be positively hot-blooded, but these patients frequently also have severe hayfever and other allergies, affecting the eyes particularly.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Graphites, local characteristics of skin problems which respond to Lycopodium and Sepia are not very specific and these medicines are prescribed mostly on the basis of the mental and general features. The type of person who typically responds to Lycopodium clavatum is reserved or shy, and there may be underlying anxiety or depression. They frequently have stomach problems. Odd but characteristic features include a sweet tooth and a bad period in late afternoon, feeling better later. It can be useful for a range of skin problems including psoriasis and acne.\r\n\r\nSepia officinalis is most often indicated for women. Typically the patient is emotionally flat, fed-up and snappy with her family and partner. She resents others prying (as she sees it) into her problems and may hide her feelings. Often, as with Graphites, the problem seems to have come on following some event of a woman’s reproductive cycle, such as the start of a girl’s periods, childbirth and menopause. There is usually loss of sex-drive. An odd feature is the temporary improvement from exercise (dancing, working out). Again it may be useful for many skin problems including psoriasis and eczema.\r\n\r\nHowever constitutional homeopathy is not the only kind of homeopathy and unless one of the “pictures” described above really seems to fit, is perhaps best left to a practitioner. There are a number of “small” homeopathic medicines which work well prescribed on characteristic symptoms, sometimes called “keynotes”. These include Petroleum (made from crude oil). The keynote for this medicine is the marked deterioration in winter. It is very useful for children who get thick cracked skin of the knuckles in winter.

(99, 1, '2017-08-11 10:10:48', '2017-08-11 10:10:48', 'Diabetes has 3 distinct phases:\r\n\r\n1: Increased demand of insulin and limited supply\r\n\r\n2. Decreased production of insulin and increased demand\r\n\r\n3. No formation of insulin in the body\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wETw5Tm9gWE\r\n\r\nDiabetes is a metabolic disorder in which our body’s use of food for production of energy is affected. Most of the food we eat is carbohydrates, and this is broken down by the digestive juices into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is the main source of energy for the body. After digestion, the glucose passes into our bloodstream where it is available for body cells to use for growth and energy. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, facilitates the entry of glucose into our cells. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to produce the right amount of insulin to move the glucose from our blood into our cells. In diabetics, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the body cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. Due to this, glucose levels rise in the blood, floods into the urine and passes out of the body, making the body lose its main source of fuel.\r\n\r\nIn one national study on diabetes completed in 1989, about 2% of the 12,000 people surveyed in Indian villages were found to be diabetic, and more alarming observation was that half of them did not know that they had diabetes. This infers that there are at least 20 million diabetics in India, which is the highest ever reported number from anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"…The overall incidence of diabetes  was 20.2 per 1000 person years of follow up while the overall incidence of pre-diabetes was 13.1 per 1000 person years of follow up.  These figures appear to be much higher than those published from the west showing  once again the well known increased susceptibility of Indians to diabetes…"…Incidence Data on Diabetes from India by Shashank R Joshi*\r\n\r\nThere are three types of diabetes. Type I - occurs when the pancreas produces very little or no insulin at all. Approximately 10 percent of people with diabetes, mostly children and young adults, have Type I diabetes. Type II - occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot use the insulin produced effectively. 90 percent of people with diabetes have Type II. Gestational - is a temporary condition that occurs during pregnancy. It affects 2 to 4 percent of all pregnancies with an increased risk of developing diabetes for both mother and child. Type II diabetes is often preceded by a set of symptoms called Syndrome X, which leads to insulin resistance. Among the signs of Syndrome X are feeling tired after you eat and other times when you shouldn''t, gaining weight and having trouble losing it, and having blood pressure and cholesterol levels creep up over time. Syndrome X can be reversed through proper diet and exercise.\r\n\r\nConventional medicine often uses insulin itself in the treatment of diabetes. This being just a replacement therapy, diabetes becomes a life-long disease. Homoeopathy can be used effectively in the treatment of diabetes. Here we mainly concentrate on functioning of the pancreas in efficient insulin production. Medicines such as Helonias 200, Iodum 200, Syzygium Jambolanum θ (Mother Tincture) are used by us effectively in the treatment of all the stages of the diseases. Often, patients come to us already under insulin replacement. In such cases we advise the continuance of the replacement ahile starting them off on our medicines. After some months, when we see a consistent control over the blood sugar levels, we taper off the conventional replacement therapy. Complications of the disease can also be taken care of by symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nMost diseases are surrounded by a number of myths. This stems basically from ignorance or lack of proper information. Similarly, diabetes too has given rise to a number of imaginary beliefs. It is imperative to debunk some of these widely prevailing myths and present the facts about this sweet killer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Eating too much sugar causes diabetes.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> There is no proof that sugar is the main cause behind diabetes. Diabetes is more related to family history, wrong eating habits and little or no physical activity.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Healthy foods don''t raise blood sugar.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> The fact is that all foods provide carbohydrates. And if there is enough insulin present in the body naturally or provided by injections, it will utilise the carbohydrates and consequently the blood sugar will not rise. However, if your body is producing less insulin or not utilising it sufficiently, then blood sugar is bound to rise even if you eat healthy foods.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Only medical treatment can control diabetes.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Diabetes is a disease that requires dietary intervention along with medical treatment. Medications are only a part of the cure. What is also needed is a healthy lifestyle behaviour that will allow the medication to work more effectively. This comes with a healthy, well balanced diet as well as a regular exercise routine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Diabetics have to eat special foods.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Diabetics can eat the same food as non-diabetics, but in moderation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> No diet modification is required, if external insulin is being administered.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Insulin is not replacing a meal plan or involvement in any physical activity. Thus diet modification is needed, irrespective of whether insulin is being given or not.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Exercises are of no help in diabetes.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Exercise helps the pancreas to secrete more insulin, while at the same time, keeps the stress levels under control. Both these factors help to keep the blood sugar under control.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> People with diabetes can eat any number of sugar free products\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Sugar free does not mean calorie free. It is advisable to keep a check on the calorie product of the food, before consuming it. This way the total calorie intake can be kept under control and will further help in keeping a check on the blood sugar.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth :</strong> I don''t have a family history of diabetes, so I won''t get it.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> Some people are born with a greater chance of developing diabetes than others. However, plenty of people diagnosed with the disease don''t have a family history of diabetes. Your weight and lifestyle can be factors in whether you develop diabetes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> The strain and stress of everyday life is not related to diabetes.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> The fact is that everyday stresses, as well as emotional and crisis situation can play a role in raising the blood sugar. Hence people with diabetes should take time out to relax and keep their stress levels under control.\r\n\r\n<em>A proper understanding of any disease means having a thorough knowledge about the disease, its causes and effects.

[Uran]\r\nThis remedy is praised highly by Hughes and others in diabetes originating in dyspepsia. It has polyuria, polydypsia, dryness of the mouth and skin. It causes sugar in the urine. Dr. Laning said that no remedy gives such universally good results; it lessens the sugar and quantity of the urine; he recommended the 3X trituration. It is when the disease is due to assimilative derangements that Uranium is the remedy, and symptoms such as defective digestion, languor, debility and much sugar in the urine, enormous appetite and thirst, yet the patient continues to emaciate. Syzygium jambolanum is a remedy capable of diminishing the amount of sugar in the urine, especially when used in the tincture and lower triturations, and some cases have been reported cured, but it cannot be considered a reliable drug , and its use seems entirely palliative.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid [Phos]\r\ncorresponds to diabetes of nervous origin; the urine is increased, perhaps milky in color and containing much sugar. It suits cases due to grief, worriment and anxiety, those who are indifferent and apathetic, poor in mental and physical force. It is unquestionably curative of diabetes mellitus in the early stages, great debility and bruised feeling in the muscles. There will be loss of appetite, sometimes unquenchable thirst and perhaps the patient will be troubled with boils. When patients pass large quantities of pale colorless urine or where there is much phosphatic deposit in the urine it is the remedy. It thus may be a remedy in the form known as diabetes insipidus. Hering considered Plumbum one of the most important remedies in diabetes mellitus. Causticum, Scilla and Strophanthus may be of use in diabetes insipidus. Lycopodium cured a case in a weary, wretched patient; emaciated, increased appetite and great thirst; pale, profuse urine. Eight quarts in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus. [Phos]\r\nUseful in diabetes and pancreatic diseases, especially in those of a tuberculous or gouty diathesis. The pancreatic involvement will call attention to Phosphorus. Natrum sulphuricum corresponds to the hydrogenoid constitution, with dry mouth and throat,and Arsenicum should be studied in diabetic gangrene, thirst and emaciation. Sudden and extreme dryness of the mouth and marked physical restlessness are also guiding symptoms to this remedy, especially with a dark watery stool. Dr. P.Jousset reports positive success where the mouth is dry; frequent, abundant urination and tendency to skin eruption.\r\n\r\nLactic acid. [Lact]\r\nAn exceedingly good remedy in the gastrohepatic variety of diabetes and good results often follow its use. It has a fine clinical record. The symptoms are: urinates copiously and freely, urine light yellow and saccharine, thirst, nausea, debility, voracious appetite and costive bowels. Dry skin, dry tongue, gastralgia. Acetic acid is also a valuable diabetic remedy, and it has passing of large quantities of pale urine, intense thirst, hot, dry skin and marked debility Carbolic acid may also be found useful.\r\n\r\nBryonia. [Bry]\r\nShould not be neglected in this disease. No remedy has dryness of the lips as a symptom of hepatic disorder more marked than Bryonia, and this is often one of the first symptom of diabetes. There is a persistent bitter taste, the patient is languid, morose and dispirited, thirst may not be extreme nor the appetite voracious, the patient may lose strength through inability to eat. Podophyllum has a bitter taste, but the tongue is flabby. It may be of use in the disease. Chionanthus is a remedy used by the Eclectic School upon the indications of thirst, frequent and copious urine; constipation with stools light colored, devoid of bile. Functional liver disorders. Argentum metallicum. Hahnemann suggests the use of this remedy in diuresis, it is decided use in diabetes insipidus. The urine is profuse, turbid and of sweet odor. Micturition is frequent and copious. Natrum sulphuricum. Hinsdale reports good results with this remedy. It has polyuria, intense itching of the skin, especially upon the upper surface of the thighs. It is the Tissue Remedy of diabetes.\r\n\r\nInsulin. [Insulin]\r\nLong before the discovery of Insulin Dr.Pierre Jousset of Paris prepared a pancreatic juice on a glycerine basis which he administered to diabetic patients in doses of 10 or 20 drops a day in water and had results sufficiently good to consider pancreatic juice, orally administered, as a remedy of great value in diabetes. Dr. Cartier, his practical successor, praised it insisted on smaller doses given by mouth as larger doses and hypodermic injections of it had no effect in ordinary diabetes. Baker advises the homoeopathic strengths of Insulin 3d to 30th and reports happy results therefrom. Great care must be taken not to overdose. Boericke says that it maintains the blood sugar at a normal level and the urine remains free of sugar. Epileptic convulsions and mental derangements have been produced by hypodermic use of this hormone.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

Decreased production of insulin and increased demand\r\n\r\n3. No formation of insulin in the body\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wETw5Tm9gWE\r\n\r\nDiabetes is a metabolic disorder in which our body’s use of food for production of energy is affected. Most of the food we eat is carbohydrates, and this is broken down by the digestive juices into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is the main source of energy for the body. After digestion, the glucose passes into our bloodstream where it is available for body cells to use for growth and energy. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, facilitates the entry of glucose into our cells. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to produce the right amount of insulin to move the glucose from our blood into our cells. In diabetics, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the body cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. Due to this, glucose levels rise in the blood, floods into the urine and passes out of the body, making the body lose its main source of fuel.\r\n\r\nIn one national study on diabetes completed in 1989, about 2% of the 12,000 people surveyed in Indian villages were found to be diabetic, and more alarming observation was that half of them did not know that they had diabetes. This infers that there are at least 20 million diabetics in India, which is the highest ever reported number from anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n"…The overall incidence of diabetes  was 20.2 per 1000 person years of follow up while the overall incidence of pre-diabetes was 13.1 per 1000 person years of follow up.  These figures appear to be much higher than those published from the west showing  once again the well known increased susceptibility of Indians to diabetes…"…Incidence Data on Diabetes from India by Shashank R Joshi*\r\n\r\nThere are three types of diabetes. Type I - occurs when the pancreas produces very little or no insulin at all. Approximately 10 percent of people with diabetes, mostly children and young adults, have Type I diabetes. Type II - occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot use the insulin produced effectively. 90 percent of people with diabetes have Type II. Gestational - is a temporary condition that occurs during pregnancy. It affects 2 to 4 percent of all pregnancies with an increased risk of developing diabetes for both mother and child. Type II diabetes is often preceded by a set of symptoms called Syndrome X, which leads to insulin resistance. Among the signs of Syndrome X are feeling tired after you eat and other times when you shouldn''t, gaining weight and having trouble losing it, and having blood pressure and cholesterol levels creep up over time. Syndrome X can be reversed through proper diet and exercise.\r\n\r\nConventional medicine often uses insulin itself in the treatment of diabetes. This being just a replacement therapy, diabetes becomes a life-long disease. Homoeopathy can be used effectively in the treatment of diabetes. Here we mainly concentrate on functioning of the pancreas in efficient insulin production. Medicines such as Helonias 200, Iodum 200, Syzygium Jambolanum θ (Mother Tincture) are used by us effectively in the treatment of all the stages of the diseases. Often, patients come to us already under insulin replacement. In such cases we advise the continuance of the replacement ahile starting them off on our medicines. After some months, when we see a consistent control over the blood sugar levels, we taper off the conventional replacement therapy. Complications of the disease can also be taken care of by symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nMost diseases are surrounded by a number of myths. This stems basically from ignorance or lack of proper information. Similarly, diabetes too has given rise to a number of imaginary beliefs. It is imperative to debunk some of these widely prevailing myths and present the facts about this sweet killer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Eating too much sugar causes diabetes.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> There is no proof that sugar is the main cause behind diabetes. Diabetes is more related to family history, wrong eating habits and little or no physical activity.\r\n\r\n<strong>Myth:</strong> Healthy foods don''t raise blood sugar.\r\n<strong>Fact:</strong> The fact is that all foods provide carbohydrates.

If you understand the thinking of the youngsters, you will know that the biggest fear in the minds of youngsters, more so in girls is that it will affect their looks badly. This can in fact affect their self esteem also. Due to acne, the the skin of the face tends to become rough and the natural smooth texture of the facial skin is lost. The eruptions tend to have pus in them and there is pain on touch and sometimes otherwise too. Some people try to pick at the pimples but that is not the right thing to do as it will always leave scars on the face. While the growing age is a sensitive time even otherwise for kids, they find it quite difficult to handle such a problem which does not have an easy solution. While they have a great desire to look good, the presence of pimples on the face or scars therefrom can cause them to lose confidence. It has often been observed that such teenagers tend to withdraw from company. Most of the medicines and the cosmetic creams offer little relief on a lasting basis. Once the medicines are stopped, the acne come back with a vengeance. A lot of advertisements seen in newspapers and other media promise magical cures for pimples but fall short of giving even temporary relief. They happen to be just a waste of time, money and effort. It is because none of these try to cure the root cause of the problem and are concentrating on treating just the end result.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><strong>Causes of acne</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is very important to understand the various causes or things that cause this problem to occur in the first place. There are so many things that conspire to cause this trouble. During the teenage, the body is growing at a furious pace. This growth is fuelled by a lot of changes in the horomonal system in the human body. These hormonal changes are one of the most important cause of acne. Another important factor that plays a huge role is that of stress. It is one of the causes that is often overlooked as one tends to think that youngsters will hardly have any sort of stress at this tender age. On the contrary, the youngsters are also subject to a lot of stress and have poorly defined mechanisms to deal with this stress. The present scenario of personal issues, competitive exams, pressure of studies and peer pressure offer a lot of reasons for the teenagers to feel stressed.\r\n\r\nMultiple factors are at play when it comes to causing acne. In the growing age, there are a lot of hormonal changes that occur in the human body and they are the most prominent cause of acne. Another factor that tends to aggravate this trouble is the underlying stress. The cause of this stress may be related to personal life, career, studies or peer pressure but the effect on human body remains the same. Ironically, the creams that claim to cure acne in a magical way may themselves be the cause or aggravating factor of acne. Having an oily face which means that there is increased production of sebum, is also one contributory factor to acne, though people with dry skin are also affected by acne.\r\n\r\nThe present day food habits of youngsters too become a contributory factor in the incidence of pimples. Junk food, which has become more or less the staple diet can be a major factor which increases the occurrence of acne. Fried food, too much intake of sweets and little intake of fibre rich food all tend to aggravate this problem. It has been observed that there is some familial incidence of this problem, which means that you are more likely to suffer from this trouble if your parents or siblings also had it but this does not mean that you are sure to have it or that this is a hereditary problem. Cosmetics which can cause dryness or interfere with the production of sebum can also contribute to this problem.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do’s and Dont’s</strong>\r\n\r\nTake a lot of water whether you feel thirsty or not. Drinking at least 10-12 glasses in a day is advisable and more your intake, the better it is. At the same time, the diet should consist of fresh fruits and vegetables so that the intake of fibre, necessary minerals and vitamins is good. One should avoid processed foods, fried foods and junk food. It is not advisable to pick the pimples or rub them with a hard cloth or towel. One should wash the face with plain water more than once in a day.

If you understand the thinking of the youngsters, you will know that the biggest fear in the minds of youngsters, more so in girls is that it will affect their looks badly. This can in fact affect their self esteem also. Due to acne, the the skin of the face tends to become rough and the natural smooth texture of the facial skin is lost. The eruptions tend to have pus in them and there is pain on touch and sometimes otherwise too. Some people try to pick at the pimples but that is not the right thing to do as it will always leave scars on the face. While the growing age is a sensitive time even otherwise for kids, they find it quite difficult to handle such a problem which does not have an easy solution. While they have a great desire to look good, the presence of pimples on the face or scars therefrom can cause them to lose confidence. It has often been observed that such teenagers tend to withdraw from company. Most of the medicines and the cosmetic creams offer little relief on a lasting basis. Once the medicines are stopped, the acne come back with a vengeance. A lot of advertisements seen in newspapers and other media promise magical cures for pimples but fall short of giving even temporary relief. They happen to be just a waste of time, money and effort. It is because none of these try to cure the root cause of the problem and are concentrating on treating just the end result.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><strong>Causes of acne</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is very important to understand the various causes or things that cause this problem to occur in the first place. There are so many things that conspire to cause this trouble. During the teenage, the body is growing at a furious pace. This growth is fuelled by a lot of changes in the horomonal system in the human body. These hormonal changes are one of the most important cause of acne. Another important factor that plays a huge role is that of stress. It is one of the causes that is often overlooked as one tends to think that youngsters will hardly have any sort of stress at this tender age. On the contrary, the youngsters are also subject to a lot of stress and have poorly defined mechanisms to deal with this stress. The present scenario of personal issues, competitive exams, pressure of studies and peer pressure offer a lot of reasons for the teenagers to feel stressed.\r\n\r\nMultiple factors are at play when it comes to causing acne. In the growing age, there are a lot of hormonal changes that occur in the human body and they are the most prominent cause of acne. Another factor that tends to aggravate this trouble is the underlying stress. The cause of this stress may be related to personal life, career, studies or peer pressure but the effect on human body remains the same. Ironically, the creams that claim to cure acne in a magical way may themselves be the cause or aggravating factor of acne. Having an oily face which means that there is increased production of sebum, is also one contributory factor to acne, though people with dry skin are also affected by acne.\r\n\r\nThe present day food habits of youngsters too become a contributory factor in the incidence of pimples. Junk food, which has become more or less the staple diet can be a major factor which increases the occurrence of acne. Fried food, too much intake of sweets and little intake of fibre rich food all tend to aggravate this problem. It has been observed that there is some familial incidence of this problem, which means that you are more likely to suffer from this trouble if your parents or siblings also had it but this does not mean that you are sure to have it or that this is a hereditary problem. Cosmetics which can cause dryness or interfere with the production of sebum can also contribute to this problem.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do’s and Dont’s</strong>\r\n\r\nTake a lot of water whether you feel thirsty or not. Drinking at least 10-12 glasses in a day is advisable and more your intake, the better it is. At the same time, the diet should consist of fresh fruits and vegetables so that the intake of fibre, necessary minerals and vitamins is good. One should avoid processed foods, fried foods and junk food. It is not advisable to pick the pimples or rub them with a hard cloth or towel. One should wash the face with plain water more than once in a day. It helps to wash off the dirt, perspiration and smoke particles that may have stuck to the skin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Homeopathic Treatment of acne </strong>\r\n\r\nHomeopathic medicines are able to root out this problem as Homeopathy recognises the various causative factors and take them into consideration while prescribing the right medicine.

The outcome of which is extremely poor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong>: where a single dose of a single remedy is given and will give you the <strong>best results</strong>. But please make sure that your homeopath is not giving you and charging for placebo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptom specific treatments</strong>: where only the symptoms or the effects of autism are treated. This will also give very poor results. This is also called HOMEO-ALLOPATHY.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong> has been used with some success to alleviate symptoms, both mental and physical, or to cure individuals with autism. For many parents who have seen a large overall improvement in their autistic children, homeopathy has played a major role.\r\n\r\nIn traditional classical homeopathy remedy selection has been based on trying to address the person in totality looking at the following:\r\n<div class="page" title="Page 1">\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Behaviors</li>\r\n 	<li>Physical Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Emotional Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Genetic weaknesses (also identified as miasms or constitutions)</li>\r\n 	<li>Environmental factors such as vaccinations, drugs or other environmental toxinsIf the remedy is correctly selected based on the whole individual then improvement is seen in all areas. Based on the idea that our own individual weaknesses leave us susceptible to disease, the vital force weakness is addressed to restore true, global health. In autistic individuals homeopathy is trying to determine the individual’s susceptibility to autism to both cure and prevent a re-occurrence of symptoms.In classical homeopathy there is no set protocol such as in the Timeline or Sequential methods. Although the potentized forms of vaccines have been commonly used to successfully treat ASD individuals, it is advised that we always take a full case and give the remedy that most closely matches the individual’s expression of their disease or suffering at that time. It is also understood that while the vaccine remedy may help with the effects of the vaccine, that once that clear has been done, we might then uncover the underlying susceptibility which indicates the individual’s sensitivity to the vaccine in the first place.Even though there is a relatively high rate of cure with ADD/HD individuals, it is still believed that a full recovery from autism through homeopathy is not usual. However, many homeopaths see big improvements in the symptoms and behaviors of ASD individuals, even if a complete recovery is not cited. It is generally thought in the homeopathic community that starting treatment as early as possible improves the chance of a successful recovery from autism. Ideally treatment should begin before age 5. It is often observed that as children with ASD age, they seem to get further and further away from us and it is harder to bring them back. Cases are also often complicated by other interventions such as allopathic drugs, vaccinations, behavioral therapies, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n\r\nMost homeopaths see curing autism as a long term project that can take months or even years as they try different remedies in their quest to understand the individual well enough to select the true similimum. Sometimes there is an element of trial and error as the homeopath experiments with different remedies and potencies in order to find one that resonates with the child. When they do find a remedy that resonates then the effect is usually quite evident and significant improvements can be seen. Homeopaths will ask parents to not introduce any other treatments or interventions in the earlier stages of homeopathy so they can observe the direct effects of the homeopathic treatment.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mrpz7rQZuk8\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>About Autism: Why Was My Child Diagnosed with Autism? And What Does It Mean?</h3>\r\nYour child has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and you have asked for help. This is an important turning point in a long journey. For some families, it may be the point when, after a long search for answers, you now have a name for something you didn’t know what to call, but you knew existed. Perhaps you suspected autism, but held out hope that an evaluation would prove otherwise. Many families report mixed feelings of sadness and relief when their child is diagnosed. You may feel completely overwhelmed. You may also feel relieved to know that the concerns you have had for your child are valid. Whatever it is you feel, know that thousands of parents share this journey. You are not alone. There is reason to hope. There is help. Now that you have the diagnosis, the question is, where do you go from here?\r\n\r\nThe Autism Speaks 100 Day Kit was created to help you make the best possible use of the next 100 days in the life of your child. It contains information and advice collected from trusted and respected experts on autism and parents like you.\r\n<h3>Why Does My Child Need a Diagnosis of Autism?</h3>\r\nParents are usually the first to notice the early signs of autism. You probably noticed that your child was developing differently from his or her peers. The differences may have existed from birth or may have become more noticeable later. Sometimes, the differences are severe and obvious to everyone. In other cases, they are more subtle and are first recognized by a daycare provider or preschool teacher. Those differences, the symptoms of autism, have led thousands of parents like you to seek answers that have resulted in a diagnosis of autism. You may wonder: Why does my child need a diagnosis of autism? That’s a fair question to ask - especially when right now, no one is able to offer you a cure. Autism Speaks is dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. Great strides have been made and the current state of progress is a far cry from the time when parents were given no hope for their children.\r\n\r\nSome of the most brilliant minds of our time have turned their attention toward this disorder. It is important to remember that your child is the same unique, lovable, wonderful person he or she was before the diagnosis. There are, however, several reasons why having a diagnosis is important for your child. A thorough and detailed diagnosis provides important information about your child’s behavior and development. It can help create a roadmap for treatment by identifying your child’s specific strengths and challenges and providing useful information about which needs and skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>How is Autism Diagnosed?</h3>\r\nPresently, we don’t have a medical test that can diagnose autism. As the symptoms of autism vary, so do the routes to obtaining a diagnosis. You may have raised questions with your pediatrician. Some children are identified as having developmental delays before obtaining a diagnosis of autism and may already receive some Early Intervention or Special Education services. Unfortunately, parents’ concerns are sometimes not taken seriously by their doctor and as a result, a diagnosis is delayed. Autism Speaks and other autism-related organizations are working hard to educate parents and physicians, so that children with autism are identified as early as possible.\r\n\r\nYour child may have been diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician, a neurologist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. In some cases, a team of specialists may have evaluated your child and provided recommendations for treatment. The team may have included an audiologist to rule out hearing loss, a speech &amp; language therapist to determine language skills and needs and an occupational therapist to evaluate physical and motor skills. A multi-disciplinary evaluation is important for diagnosing autism and other challenges that often accompany autism, such as delays in motor skills.\r\n\r\nIf your child has not been evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team, you will want to make sure further evaluations are conducted so that you can learn as much as possible about your child’s individual strengths and needs.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received a formal diagnosis, it is important to make sure that you ask for a comprehensive report that includes the diagnosis in writing, as well as recommendations for treatment. The doctor may not be able to provide this for you at the appointment, as it may take some time to compile, but be sure to follow up and pick up this helpful necessary report as soon as it’s available. skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>What is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (commonly referred to as the DSM-5), all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD.\r\n\r\nPreviously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger Syndrome. The DSM is the main diagnostic reference used by mental health professionals and insurance providers in the United States. You may also hear the terms Classic Autism or Kanner’s Autism (named after the first psychiatrist to describe autism) used to describe the most severe form of the disorder.\r\n\r\nUnder the current DSM-5, the diagnosis of autism requires that at least six developmental and behavioral characteristics are observed, that problems are present before the age of three and that there is no evidence of certain other conditions that are similar.\r\n<h4>There are two domains where people with ASD must show persistent deficits:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><em>persistent social communication and social interaction </em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior </em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMore specifically, people with ASD must demonstrate (either in the past or in the present) deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction and deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they must show at least two types of repetitive patterns of behavior, including stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, insistence on sameness or inflexible adherence to routines, highly restricted, fixated interests, hyper or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment. Symptoms can be currently present or reported in past history.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the diagnosis, each person evaluated will also be described in terms of any known genetic cause (e.g. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome), level of language and intellectual disability and presence of medical conditions such as seizures, anxiety, depression and/or gastrointestinal (GI) problems.\r\n\r\nThe DSM-5 has an additional category called Social Communication Disorder (SCD). This allows for a diagnosis of disabilities in social communication, without the presence of repetitive behavior. SCD is a new diagnosis and much more research and information is needed. There are currently few guidelines for the treatment of SCD. Until such guidelines become available, treatments that target socialcommunication, including many autism-specific interventions, should be provided to individuals with SCD.\r\n<h3>How Common is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released in March 2014 identify around 1 in 68 American children as on the autism spectrum – a ten-fold increase in prevalence in 40 years. Careful research shows that this increase is only partly explained by improved diagnosis and awareness. Studies also show that autism is four to five times more common among boys than girls. An estimated 1 out of 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls are diagnosed with autism in the United States.\r\n\r\nASD affects over 2 million individuals in the U.S. and tens of millions worldwide. Moreover, government autism statistics suggest that prevalence rates have increased 10% to 17% annually in recent years. There is no established explanation for this continuing increase, although improved diagnosis and environmental influences are two reasons often considered.\r\n<h3>What Causes Autism?</h3>\r\nNot long ago, the answer to this question would have been “we have no idea.” Research is now delivering the answers. First and foremost, we now know that there is no one cause of autism, just as there is no one type of autism. Over the last five years, scientists have identified a number of rare gene changes or mutations associated with autism. Research has identified more than 100 autism risk genes. In around 15% of cases, a specific genetic cause of a person’s autism can be identified. However, most cases involve a complex and variable combination of genetic risk and environmental factors that influence early brain development. In other words, in the presence of a genetic predisposition to autism, a number of non-genetic or environmental influences further increase a child’s risk.\r\n\r\nThe clearest evidence of these environmental risk factors involves events before and during birth. They include advanced parental age at time of conception (both mom and dad), maternal illness during pregnancy, extreme prematurity, very low birth weight and certain difficulties during birth, particularly those involving periods of oxygen deprivation to the baby’s brain. Mothers exposed to high levels of pesticides and air pollution may also be at higher risk of having a child with ASD.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that these factors, <em>by themselves</em>, do not cause autism. Rather, in combination with genetic risk factors, they appear to modestly increase risk. A small but growing body of research suggests that autism risk is lower among children whose mothers took prenatal vitamins (containing folic acid) in the months before and after conception. Increasingly, researchers are looking at the role of the immune system in autism. Autism Speaks is working to increase awareness and investigation of these and other issues where further research has the potential to improve the lives of those who struggle with autism.\r\n\r\nWhile the causes of autism are complex, it is abundantly clear that it is not caused by bad parenting. Dr. Leo Kanner, the psychiatrist who first described autism as a unique condition in 1943, believed that it was caused by cold, unloving mothers. Bruno Bettelheim, a renowned professor of child development, perpetuated this misinterpretation of autism. Their promotion of the idea that unloving mothers caused their children’s autism created a generation of parents who carried the tremendous burden of guilt for their child’s disability.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Dr. Bernard Rimland, the father of a son with autism who later founded the Autism Society of America and the Autism Research Institute, helped the medical community understand that autism is a biological disorder and is not caused by cold parents.\r\n<h3>More Information about Symptoms of Autism</h3>\r\nAutism affects the way an individual perceives the world and makes communication and social interaction difficult. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social-interaction difficulties, communication challenges and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors. However, symptoms and their severity vary widely across these three core areas. Taken together, they may result in relatively mild challenges for someone on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum.\r\n\r\nFor others, symptoms may be more severe, as when repetitive behaviors and lack of spoken language interfere with everyday life. It is sometimes said that if you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism. While autism is usually a life long condition, all children and adults benefit from interventions, or therapies, that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities. Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible, the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe long term outcome is highly variable. A small percentage of children lose their diagnosis over time, while others remain severely affected. Many have normal cognitive skills, despite challenges in social and language abilities. Many individuals with autism develop speech and learn to communicate with others. Early intervention can make extraordinary differences in your child’s development. How your child is functioning now may be very different from how he or she will function later on in life.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>The information following on the social symptoms, communication disorders and repetitive behaviors associated with autism is partially taken from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) website.</strong></em>\r\n<h3>Social symptoms</h3>\r\nTypically developing infants are social by nature. They gaze at faces, turn toward voices, grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age. By contrast, most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions. By 8 to 10 months of age, many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names, reduced interest in people and delayed babbling. By toddlerhood, many children with autism have difficulty playing social games, don’t imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone. They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents’ displays of anger or affection in typical ways.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that children with autism are attached to their parents. However, the way they express this attachment can be unusual. To parents, it may seem as if their child is disconnected. Both children and adults with autism also tend to have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues such as a smile, wave or grimace may convey little meaning. To a person who misses these social cues, a statement like “Come here!” may mean the same thing, regardless of whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips.\r\n\r\nWithout the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world can seem bewildering. Many people with autism have similar difficulty seeing things from another person’s perspective. Most five-year-olds understand that other people have different thoughts, feelings and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This, in turn, can interfere with the ability to predict or understand another person’s actions.\r\n\r\nIt is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions. This can take the form of seemingly “immature” behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations. It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior. The tendency to “lose control” may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar, overwhelming or frustrating situations. Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging, hair pulling or self-biting.\r\n\r\nFortunately, children with autism can be taught how to socially interact, use gestures and recognize facial expressions. Also, there are many strategies that can be used to help the child with autism deal with frustration so that he or she doesn’t have to resort to challenging behaviors. We will discuss this later.\r\n<h3>Communication difficulties</h3>\r\nYoung children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling, speaking and learning to use gestures. Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors. Others experience significant language delays and don’t begin to speak until much later. With therapy, however, most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate.\r\n\r\nMany nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures, sign language, electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices. When language begins to develop, people with autism may use speech in unusual ways. Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences. They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over. Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim (echolalia). Many parents assume difficulties expressing language automatically mean their child isn’t able to understand the language of others, but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nIt is important to distinguish between expressive language and receptive language. Children with difficulties in expressive language are often unable to express what they are thinking through language, whereas children with difficulties in receptive language are often unable to understand what others are saying. Therefore, the fact that your child may seem unable to express him or herself through language does not necessarily mean he or she is unable to comprehend the language of others. Be sure to talk to your doctor or look for signs that your child is able to interpret language, as this important distinction will affect the way you communicate with him or her.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand the importance of pragmatics when looking to improve and expand upon your child’s communication skills. Pragmatics are social rules for using language in a meaningful context or conversation. While it is important that your child learns how to communicate through words or sentences, it is also key to emphasize both when and where the specific message should be conveyed. Challenges in pragmatics are a common feature of spoken language difficulties in children with autism. These challenges may become more apparent as your child gets older. Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation. Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject, giving others little chance to comment. In other words, the ordinary “give-and-take” of conversation proves difficult. Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors, failing to pick up on the “kid-speak” that’s common among their peers.\r\n\r\nAnother common difficulty is the inability to understand body language, tone of voice and expressions that aren’t meant to be taken literally. For example, even an adult with autism might interpret a sarcastic “Oh, that’s just great!” as meaning it really is great. Conversely, individuals affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language. Facial expressions, movements and gestures may not match what they are saying. Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings. Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat, robot-like voice. This can make it difficult for others to know what they want and need. This failed communication, in turn, can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior (such as screaming or grabbing) on the part of the person with autism.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs. As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants, challenging behaviors often subside. Children with autism often have difficulty letting others know what they want or need until they are taught how to communicate through speech, gestures or other means.\r\n<h3>Repetitive behaviors</h3>\r\nUnusual repetitive behaviors and/or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism. Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping, rocking, jumping and twirling, arranging and rearranging objects and repeating sounds, words or phrases. Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating, such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes. The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys. Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play. Similarly, some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place. It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine. Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts. Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations or obsessions. These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content (e.g. fans, vacuum cleaners or toilets) or depth of knowledge (e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy). Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers, symbols, dates or science topics. Many children with autism need and demand absolute consistency in their environment.\r\n<h3>Unique Abilities that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nAlong with the challenges that autism involves, you may have noticed that your child also exhibits areas of strength. Although not all children have special talents, it is not uncommon for individuals with autism to have exceptional skills in math, music, art and reading, among others. These areas of expertise can provide great satisfaction and pride for the child with autism. If possible, incorporate your child’s areas of expertise into his or her everyday activities and use them whenever possible as a way for him or her to learn and excel.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>The following is adapted from Sally Ozonoff, Geraldine Dawson and James McPartland’s A Parent’s Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism. </em></strong>\r\n\r\nJust as individuals with autism have a variety of difficulties, they also have some distinctive strengths. Some of the strengths that individuals with autism have may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ability to understand concrete concepts, rules and sequences</li>\r\n 	<li>Strong long term memory skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Math skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Computer skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Musical ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Artistic ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to think in a visual way</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to decode written language at an early age (This ability is called Hyperlexia – some children with autism can decode written language earlier than they can comprehend written language.)</li>\r\n 	<li>Honesty – sometimes to a fault</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to be extremely focused – if they are working on a preferred activity</li>\r\n 	<li>Excellent sense of direction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>“How Can My Child Have Autism When He Seems So Smart?” From Does My Child Have Autism? by Wendy Stone</h4>\r\nRight now you might be thinking about all the things your child with autism learned at a much younger age than other children you know. And yes, you are right: there are also things that children with autism learn on their own much faster than their typically developing peers or siblings.\r\n\r\nFor example, they can be very good at learning to pick out their favorite DVD from a stack, even when it’s not in its case. They may learn at a very young age how to operate the remote controls to the TV and DVD player so that they can rewind their videos to their favorite parts (or fast forward through the parts they don’t like). They can be very creative in figuring out ways to climb up on the counter to reach a cabinet that has their favorite cereal or even how to use the key to unlock the dead bolt on the back door so they can go outside to play on the swing.\r\n\r\nClearly, these are not behaviors that you would even think about trying to teach a two-year-old child. And yet some children with autism somehow manage to acquire these skills on their own. How can we understand this inconsistency between the things children with autism do and don’t learn? How can a child who can’t put different shapes into a shape sorter learn to turn on the TV and DVD player, put a DVD in and push the play button? How can a child who can’t understand a simple direction like “get your coat” figure out how to unlock a door to get outside? What accounts for this unique learning style?\r\n\r\nIn a word: motivation. We all pay attention better to the things that interest us, so we become much more proficient at learning them. Understanding what is motivating to your child (all children are different) will be one of the keys to increasing their learning and their skills. Your child’s special talents may be part of his unique and inherent learning style and nature.\r\n<h3>Physical and Medical Issues that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nYou can find more information about autism and epilepsy at autismspeaks.org/family-services/epilepsy. Genetic disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development. These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders. While further study is needed, single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20% of those with ASD.\r\n\r\nSome of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories, the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer your child to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing. The results can help increase awareness of associated medical issues and guide treatment and life planning.\r\n<h3>Seizure disorders</h3>\r\nSeizure Disorder, also called epilepsy, occurs in as many as one third of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy is a brain disorder marked by recurring seizures or convulsions. Experts propose that some of the brain abnormalities that are associated with autism may contribute to seizures. These abnormalities can cause changes in brain activity by disrupting neurons in the brain. Neurons are cells in the brain that process and transmit information and send signals to the rest of the body. Overloads or disturbances in the activity of these neurons can result in imbalances that cause seizures.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is more common in children who also have cognitive deficits. Some researchers have suggested that seizure disorder is more common when the child has shown a regression or loss of skills. There are different types and subtypes of seizures and a child with autism may experience more than one type. The easiest to recognize are large “grand mal” (or tonic-clonic) seizures. Others include “petit mal” (or absence) seizures and subclinical seizures, which may only be apparent in an EEG (electroencephalogram). It is not clear whether subclinical seizures have effects on language, cognition and behavior. The seizures associated with autism usually start either early in childhood or during adolescence, but may occur at any time.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned that your child may be having seizures, you should see a neurologist. The neurologist may order tests that may include an EEG, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), a CT (Computed Axial Tomography) and a CBC (Complete Blood Count). Children and adults with epilepsy are typically treated with anticonvulsants or seizure medicines to reduce or eliminate occurrences. If your child has epilepsy, you will work closely with a neurologist to find the medicine (or combination of medicines) that works the best with the fewest side effects and to learn the best ways to ensure your child’s safety during a seizure.\r\n<h3>Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders</h3>\r\nMany parents report gastrointestinal (GI) problems in their children with autism. The exact prevalence of gastrointestinal problems such as gastritis, chronic constipation, colitis and esophagitis in individuals with autism is unknown. Surveys have suggested that between 46 and 85% of children with autism have problems such as chronic constipation or diarrhea. One study identified a history of gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abnormal pattern of bowel movements, frequent constipation, frequent vomiting and frequent abdominal pain) in 70% of the children with autism.\r\n\r\nIf your child has similar symptoms, you will want to consult a gastroenterologist, preferably one who works with people with autism. Your child’s physician may be able to help you find an appropriate specialist. Pain caused by GI issues is sometimes recognized because of a change in a child’s behavior, such as an increase in self-soothing behaviors like rocking or outbursts of aggression or self-injury. Bear in mind that your child may not have the language skills to communicate the pain caused by GI issues. Treating GI problems may result in improvement in your child’s behavior. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some children may be helped by dietary intervention for GI issues, including the elimination of dairy and gluten containing foods.\r\n\r\nAs with any treatment, it is best to consult your child’s physician to develop a comprehensive plan. In January 2010, Autism Speaks initiated a campaign to inform pediatricians about the diagnosis and treatment of GI problems associated with autism. Is your child having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping through the night?\r\n\r\n<strong>Sleep problems</strong> are common in children and adolescents with autism. Having a child with sleep problems can affect the whole family. It can also have an impact on the ability of your child to benefit from therapy. Sometimes sleep issues may be caused by medical issues such as obstructive sleep apnea or gastroesophageal reflux and addressing the medical issues may solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, when there is no medical cause, sleep issues may be managed with behavioral interventions including “sleep-hygiene” measures, such as limiting the amount of sleep during the day and establishing regular bedtime routines. There is some evidence of abnormality of melatonin regulation in children with autism. While melatonin may be effective for improving the ability of children with autism to fall asleep, more research is needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>\r\n\r\nMany children with autism experience unusual responses to sensory stimuli or input. These responses are due to difficulty in processing and integrating sensory information. Vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, the sense of movement (vestibular system) and the sense of position (proprioception) can all be affected. This means that while information is sensed normally, it may be perceived much differently. Sometimes stimuli that seem “normal” to others can be experienced as painful, unpleasant or confusing by a child with Sensory Integration Dysfunction (SID), the clinical term for this characteristic. (SID may also be called Sensory Processing Disorder or Sensory Integration Disorder.) SIDs can involve hypersensitivity (also known as sensory defensiveness) or hyposensitivity. An example of hypersensitivity would be an inability to tolerate wearing clothing, being touched or being in a room with normal lighting. Hyposensitivity might be apparent in a child’s increased tolerance for pain or a constant need for sensory stimulation.\r\n\r\nTreatment for Sensory Integration Dysfunction is usually addressed with occupational therapy and/or sensory integration therapy. Pica Pica is an eating disorder involving eating things that are not food. Children between 18 and 24 months of age often eat nonfood items, but this is typically a normal part of development. Some children with autism and other developmental disabilities persist beyond the developmentally typical timeframe and continue to eat items such as dirt, clay, chalk or paint chips.\r\n\r\nChildren showing signs of persistent mouthing of fingers or objects, including toys, should be tested for elevated blood levels of lead, especially if there is a known potential for environmental exposure to lead. You should speak to your doctor about these concerns so he or she can help you with treatment. Your child’s doctor will help you to assess if your child needs a behavioral intervention or if it is something that can be managed at home.\r\n<h3>Mental health</h3>\r\nOftentimes a child diagnosed with ASD may receive an additional diagnosis such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD and anxiety are quite common and addressing these diagnoses properly can help your child make great strides. Recent studies suggest that 1 in 5 children on the autism spectrum also has ADHD and 30% struggle with an anxiety disorder such as social phobia, separation anxiety, panic disorder and specific phobias. The classic symptoms of ADHD include chronic problems with inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. However, these or similar symptoms can likewise result from autism.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is important that evaluation be made by someone with expertise in both disorders. A recent study found that just 1 in 10 children with autism and ADHD was receiving medication to relieve the ADHD symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn regards to anxiety, children with autism express anxiety or nervousness in many of the same ways as typically developing children. Understandably, many individuals with ASD have trouble communicating how they feel. Outward manifestations may be the best clues. In fact, some experts suspect that outward symptoms of anxiety – such as sweating and acting out – may be especially prominent among those with ASD. This can include a racing heart, muscular tensions and stomachaches. It is important for your child to be evaluated by a professional who has expertise in both autism and anxiety so he or she can provide the best treatment options for your child.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

The outcome of which is extremely poor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong>: where a single dose of a single remedy is given and will give you the <strong>best results</strong>. But please make sure that your homeopath is not giving you and charging for placebo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptom specific treatments</strong>: where only the symptoms or the effects of autism are treated. This will also give very poor results. This is also called HOMEO-ALLOPATHY.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong> has been used with some success to alleviate symptoms, both mental and physical, or to cure individuals with autism. For many parents who have seen a large overall improvement in their autistic children, homeopathy has played a major role.\r\n\r\nIn traditional classical homeopathy remedy selection has been based on trying to address the person in totality looking at the following:\r\n<div class="page" title="Page 1">\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Behaviors</li>\r\n 	<li>Physical Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Emotional Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Genetic weaknesses (also identified as miasms or constitutions)</li>\r\n 	<li>Environmental factors such as vaccinations, drugs or other environmental toxinsIf the remedy is correctly selected based on the whole individual then improvement is seen in all areas. Based on the idea that our own individual weaknesses leave us susceptible to disease, the vital force weakness is addressed to restore true, global health. In autistic individuals homeopathy is trying to determine the individual’s susceptibility to autism to both cure and prevent a re-occurrence of symptoms.In classical homeopathy there is no set protocol such as in the Timeline or Sequential methods. Although the potentized forms of vaccines have been commonly used to successfully treat ASD individuals, it is advised that we always take a full case and give the remedy that most closely matches the individual’s expression of their disease or suffering at that time. It is also understood that while the vaccine remedy may help with the effects of the vaccine, that once that clear has been done, we might then uncover the underlying susceptibility which indicates the individual’s sensitivity to the vaccine in the first place.\r\n\r\nEven though there is a relatively high rate of cure with ADD/HD individuals, it is still believed that a full recovery from autism through homeopathy is not usual. However, many homeopaths see big improvements in the symptoms and behaviors of ASD individuals, even if a complete recovery is not cited. It is generally thought in the homeopathic community that starting treatment as early as possible improves the chance of a successful recovery from autism. Ideally treatment should begin before age 5. It is often observed that as children with ASD age, they seem to get further and further away from us and it is harder to bring them back. Cases are also often complicated by other interventions such as allopathic drugs, vaccinations, behavioral therapies, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n\r\nMost homeopaths see curing autism as a long term project that can take months or even years as they try different remedies in their quest to understand the individual well enough to select the true similimum. Sometimes there is an element of trial and error as the homeopath experiments with different remedies and potencies in order to find one that resonates with the child. When they do find a remedy that resonates then the effect is usually quite evident and significant improvements can be seen. Homeopaths will ask parents to not introduce any other treatments or interventions in the earlier stages of homeopathy so they can observe the direct effects of the homeopathic treatment.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mrpz7rQZuk8\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>About Autism: Why Was My Child Diagnosed with Autism? And What Does It Mean?</h3>\r\nYour child has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and you have asked for help. This is an important turning point in a long journey. For some families, it may be the point when, after a long search for answers, you now have a name for something you didn’t know what to call, but you knew existed. Perhaps you suspected autism, but held out hope that an evaluation would prove otherwise. Many families report mixed feelings of sadness and relief when their child is diagnosed. You may feel completely overwhelmed. You may also feel relieved to know that the concerns you have had for your child are valid. Whatever it is you feel, know that thousands of parents share this journey. You are not alone. There is reason to hope. There is help. Now that you have the diagnosis, the question is, where do you go from here?\r\n\r\nThe Autism Speaks 100 Day Kit was created to help you make the best possible use of the next 100 days in the life of your child. It contains information and advice collected from trusted and respected experts on autism and parents like you.\r\n<h3>Why Does My Child Need a Diagnosis of Autism?</h3>\r\nParents are usually the first to notice the early signs of autism. You probably noticed that your child was developing differently from his or her peers. The differences may have existed from birth or may have become more noticeable later. Sometimes, the differences are severe and obvious to everyone. In other cases, they are more subtle and are first recognized by a daycare provider or preschool teacher. Those differences, the symptoms of autism, have led thousands of parents like you to seek answers that have resulted in a diagnosis of autism. You may wonder: Why does my child need a diagnosis of autism? That’s a fair question to ask - especially when right now, no one is able to offer you a cure. Autism Speaks is dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. Great strides have been made and the current state of progress is a far cry from the time when parents were given no hope for their children.\r\n\r\nSome of the most brilliant minds of our time have turned their attention toward this disorder. It is important to remember that your child is the same unique, lovable, wonderful person he or she was before the diagnosis. There are, however, several reasons why having a diagnosis is important for your child. A thorough and detailed diagnosis provides important information about your child’s behavior and development. It can help create a roadmap for treatment by identifying your child’s specific strengths and challenges and providing useful information about which needs and skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>How is Autism Diagnosed?</h3>\r\nPresently, we don’t have a medical test that can diagnose autism. As the symptoms of autism vary, so do the routes to obtaining a diagnosis. You may have raised questions with your pediatrician. Some children are identified as having developmental delays before obtaining a diagnosis of autism and may already receive some Early Intervention or Special Education services. Unfortunately, parents’ concerns are sometimes not taken seriously by their doctor and as a result, a diagnosis is delayed. Autism Speaks and other autism-related organizations are working hard to educate parents and physicians, so that children with autism are identified as early as possible.\r\n\r\nYour child may have been diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician, a neurologist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. In some cases, a team of specialists may have evaluated your child and provided recommendations for treatment. The team may have included an audiologist to rule out hearing loss, a speech &amp; language therapist to determine language skills and needs and an occupational therapist to evaluate physical and motor skills. A multi-disciplinary evaluation is important for diagnosing autism and other challenges that often accompany autism, such as delays in motor skills.\r\n\r\nIf your child has not been evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team, you will want to make sure further evaluations are conducted so that you can learn as much as possible about your child’s individual strengths and needs.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received a formal diagnosis, it is important to make sure that you ask for a comprehensive report that includes the diagnosis in writing, as well as recommendations for treatment. The doctor may not be able to provide this for you at the appointment, as it may take some time to compile, but be sure to follow up and pick up this helpful necessary report as soon as it’s available. skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>What is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (commonly referred to as the DSM-5), all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD.\r\n\r\nPreviously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger Syndrome. The DSM is the main diagnostic reference used by mental health professionals and insurance providers in the United States. You may also hear the terms Classic Autism or Kanner’s Autism (named after the first psychiatrist to describe autism) used to describe the most severe form of the disorder.\r\n\r\nUnder the current DSM-5, the diagnosis of autism requires that at least six developmental and behavioral characteristics are observed, that problems are present before the age of three and that there is no evidence of certain other conditions that are similar.\r\n<h4>There are two domains where people with ASD must show persistent deficits:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><em>persistent social communication and social interaction </em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior </em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMore specifically, people with ASD must demonstrate (either in the past or in the present) deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction and deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they must show at least two types of repetitive patterns of behavior, including stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, insistence on sameness or inflexible adherence to routines, highly restricted, fixated interests, hyper or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment. Symptoms can be currently present or reported in past history.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the diagnosis, each person evaluated will also be described in terms of any known genetic cause (e.g. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome), level of language and intellectual disability and presence of medical conditions such as seizures, anxiety, depression and/or gastrointestinal (GI) problems.\r\n\r\nThe DSM-5 has an additional category called Social Communication Disorder (SCD). This allows for a diagnosis of disabilities in social communication, without the presence of repetitive behavior. SCD is a new diagnosis and much more research and information is needed. There are currently few guidelines for the treatment of SCD. Until such guidelines become available, treatments that target socialcommunication, including many autism-specific interventions, should be provided to individuals with SCD.\r\n<h3>How Common is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released in March 2014 identify around 1 in 68 American children as on the autism spectrum – a ten-fold increase in prevalence in 40 years. Careful research shows that this increase is only partly explained by improved diagnosis and awareness. Studies also show that autism is four to five times more common among boys than girls. An estimated 1 out of 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls are diagnosed with autism in the United States.\r\n\r\nASD affects over 2 million individuals in the U.S. and tens of millions worldwide. Moreover, government autism statistics suggest that prevalence rates have increased 10% to 17% annually in recent years. There is no established explanation for this continuing increase, although improved diagnosis and environmental influences are two reasons often considered.\r\n<h3>What Causes Autism?</h3>\r\nNot long ago, the answer to this question would have been “we have no idea.” Research is now delivering the answers. First and foremost, we now know that there is no one cause of autism, just as there is no one type of autism. Over the last five years, scientists have identified a number of rare gene changes or mutations associated with autism. Research has identified more than 100 autism risk genes. In around 15% of cases, a specific genetic cause of a person’s autism can be identified. However, most cases involve a complex and variable combination of genetic risk and environmental factors that influence early brain development. In other words, in the presence of a genetic predisposition to autism, a number of non-genetic or environmental influences further increase a child’s risk.\r\n\r\nThe clearest evidence of these environmental risk factors involves events before and during birth. They include advanced parental age at time of conception (both mom and dad), maternal illness during pregnancy, extreme prematurity, very low birth weight and certain difficulties during birth, particularly those involving periods of oxygen deprivation to the baby’s brain. Mothers exposed to high levels of pesticides and air pollution may also be at higher risk of having a child with ASD.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that these factors, <em>by themselves</em>, do not cause autism. Rather, in combination with genetic risk factors, they appear to modestly increase risk. A small but growing body of research suggests that autism risk is lower among children whose mothers took prenatal vitamins (containing folic acid) in the months before and after conception. Increasingly, researchers are looking at the role of the immune system in autism. Autism Speaks is working to increase awareness and investigation of these and other issues where further research has the potential to improve the lives of those who struggle with autism.\r\n\r\nWhile the causes of autism are complex, it is abundantly clear that it is not caused by bad parenting. Dr. Leo Kanner, the psychiatrist who first described autism as a unique condition in 1943, believed that it was caused by cold, unloving mothers. Bruno Bettelheim, a renowned professor of child development, perpetuated this misinterpretation of autism. Their promotion of the idea that unloving mothers caused their children’s autism created a generation of parents who carried the tremendous burden of guilt for their child’s disability.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Dr. Bernard Rimland, the father of a son with autism who later founded the Autism Society of America and the Autism Research Institute, helped the medical community understand that autism is a biological disorder and is not caused by cold parents.\r\n<h3>More Information about Symptoms of Autism</h3>\r\nAutism affects the way an individual perceives the world and makes communication and social interaction difficult. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social-interaction difficulties, communication challenges and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors. However, symptoms and their severity vary widely across these three core areas. Taken together, they may result in relatively mild challenges for someone on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum.\r\n\r\nFor others, symptoms may be more severe, as when repetitive behaviors and lack of spoken language interfere with everyday life. It is sometimes said that if you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism. While autism is usually a life long condition, all children and adults benefit from interventions, or therapies, that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities. Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible, the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe long term outcome is highly variable. A small percentage of children lose their diagnosis over time, while others remain severely affected. Many have normal cognitive skills, despite challenges in social and language abilities. Many individuals with autism develop speech and learn to communicate with others. Early intervention can make extraordinary differences in your child’s development. How your child is functioning now may be very different from how he or she will function later on in life.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>The information following on the social symptoms, communication disorders and repetitive behaviors associated with autism is partially taken from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) website.</strong></em>\r\n<h3>Social symptoms</h3>\r\nTypically developing infants are social by nature. They gaze at faces, turn toward voices, grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age. By contrast, most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions. By 8 to 10 months of age, many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names, reduced interest in people and delayed babbling. By toddlerhood, many children with autism have difficulty playing social games, don’t imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone. They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents’ displays of anger or affection in typical ways.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that children with autism are attached to their parents. However, the way they express this attachment can be unusual. To parents, it may seem as if their child is disconnected. Both children and adults with autism also tend to have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues such as a smile, wave or grimace may convey little meaning. To a person who misses these social cues, a statement like “Come here!” may mean the same thing, regardless of whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips.\r\n\r\nWithout the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world can seem bewildering. Many people with autism have similar difficulty seeing things from another person’s perspective. Most five-year-olds understand that other people have different thoughts, feelings and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This, in turn, can interfere with the ability to predict or understand another person’s actions.\r\n\r\nIt is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions. This can take the form of seemingly “immature” behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations. It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior. The tendency to “lose control” may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar, overwhelming or frustrating situations. Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging, hair pulling or self-biting.\r\n\r\nFortunately, children with autism can be taught how to socially interact, use gestures and recognize facial expressions. Also, there are many strategies that can be used to help the child with autism deal with frustration so that he or she doesn’t have to resort to challenging behaviors. We will discuss this later.\r\n<h3>Communication difficulties</h3>\r\nYoung children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling, speaking and learning to use gestures. Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors. Others experience significant language delays and don’t begin to speak until much later. With therapy, however, most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate.\r\n\r\nMany nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures, sign language, electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices. When language begins to develop, people with autism may use speech in unusual ways. Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences. They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over. Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim (echolalia). Many parents assume difficulties expressing language automatically mean their child isn’t able to understand the language of others, but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nIt is important to distinguish between expressive language and receptive language. Children with difficulties in expressive language are often unable to express what they are thinking through language, whereas children with difficulties in receptive language are often unable to understand what others are saying. Therefore, the fact that your child may seem unable to express him or herself through language does not necessarily mean he or she is unable to comprehend the language of others. Be sure to talk to your doctor or look for signs that your child is able to interpret language, as this important distinction will affect the way you communicate with him or her.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand the importance of pragmatics when looking to improve and expand upon your child’s communication skills. Pragmatics are social rules for using language in a meaningful context or conversation. While it is important that your child learns how to communicate through words or sentences, it is also key to emphasize both when and where the specific message should be conveyed. Challenges in pragmatics are a common feature of spoken language difficulties in children with autism. These challenges may become more apparent as your child gets older. Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation. Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject, giving others little chance to comment. In other words, the ordinary “give-and-take” of conversation proves difficult. Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors, failing to pick up on the “kid-speak” that’s common among their peers.\r\n\r\nAnother common difficulty is the inability to understand body language, tone of voice and expressions that aren’t meant to be taken literally. For example, even an adult with autism might interpret a sarcastic “Oh, that’s just great!” as meaning it really is great. Conversely, individuals affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language. Facial expressions, movements and gestures may not match what they are saying. Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings. Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat, robot-like voice. This can make it difficult for others to know what they want and need. This failed communication, in turn, can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior (such as screaming or grabbing) on the part of the person with autism.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs. As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants, challenging behaviors often subside. Children with autism often have difficulty letting others know what they want or need until they are taught how to communicate through speech, gestures or other means.\r\n<h3>Repetitive behaviors</h3>\r\nUnusual repetitive behaviors and/or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism. Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping, rocking, jumping and twirling, arranging and rearranging objects and repeating sounds, words or phrases. Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating, such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes. The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys. Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play. Similarly, some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place. It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine. Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts. Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations or obsessions. These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content (e.g. fans, vacuum cleaners or toilets) or depth of knowledge (e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy). Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers, symbols, dates or science topics. Many children with autism need and demand absolute consistency in their environment.\r\n<h3>Unique Abilities that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nAlong with the challenges that autism involves, you may have noticed that your child also exhibits areas of strength. Although not all children have special talents, it is not uncommon for individuals with autism to have exceptional skills in math, music, art and reading, among others. These areas of expertise can provide great satisfaction and pride for the child with autism. If possible, incorporate your child’s areas of expertise into his or her everyday activities and use them whenever possible as a way for him or her to learn and excel.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>The following is adapted from Sally Ozonoff, Geraldine Dawson and James McPartland’s A Parent’s Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism. </em></strong>\r\n\r\nJust as individuals with autism have a variety of difficulties, they also have some distinctive strengths. Some of the strengths that individuals with autism have may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ability to understand concrete concepts, rules and sequences</li>\r\n 	<li>Strong long term memory skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Math skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Computer skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Musical ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Artistic ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to think in a visual way</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to decode written language at an early age (This ability is called Hyperlexia – some children with autism can decode written language earlier than they can comprehend written language.)</li>\r\n 	<li>Honesty – sometimes to a fault</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to be extremely focused – if they are working on a preferred activity</li>\r\n 	<li>Excellent sense of direction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>“How Can My Child Have Autism When He Seems So Smart?” From Does My Child Have Autism? by Wendy Stone</h4>\r\nRight now you might be thinking about all the things your child with autism learned at a much younger age than other children you know. And yes, you are right: there are also things that children with autism learn on their own much faster than their typically developing peers or siblings.\r\n\r\nFor example, they can be very good at learning to pick out their favorite DVD from a stack, even when it’s not in its case. They may learn at a very young age how to operate the remote controls to the TV and DVD player so that they can rewind their videos to their favorite parts (or fast forward through the parts they don’t like). They can be very creative in figuring out ways to climb up on the counter to reach a cabinet that has their favorite cereal or even how to use the key to unlock the dead bolt on the back door so they can go outside to play on the swing.\r\n\r\nClearly, these are not behaviors that you would even think about trying to teach a two-year-old child. And yet some children with autism somehow manage to acquire these skills on their own. How can we understand this inconsistency between the things children with autism do and don’t learn? How can a child who can’t put different shapes into a shape sorter learn to turn on the TV and DVD player, put a DVD in and push the play button? How can a child who can’t understand a simple direction like “get your coat” figure out how to unlock a door to get outside? What accounts for this unique learning style?\r\n\r\nIn a word: motivation. We all pay attention better to the things that interest us, so we become much more proficient at learning them. Understanding what is motivating to your child (all children are different) will be one of the keys to increasing their learning and their skills. Your child’s special talents may be part of his unique and inherent learning style and nature.\r\n<h3>Physical and Medical Issues that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nYou can find more information about autism and epilepsy at autismspeaks.org/family-services/epilepsy. Genetic disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development. These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders. While further study is needed, single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20% of those with ASD.\r\n\r\nSome of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories, the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer your child to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing. The results can help increase awareness of associated medical issues and guide treatment and life planning.\r\n<h3>Seizure disorders</h3>\r\nSeizure Disorder, also called epilepsy, occurs in as many as one third of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy is a brain disorder marked by recurring seizures or convulsions. Experts propose that some of the brain abnormalities that are associated with autism may contribute to seizures. These abnormalities can cause changes in brain activity by disrupting neurons in the brain. Neurons are cells in the brain that process and transmit information and send signals to the rest of the body. Overloads or disturbances in the activity of these neurons can result in imbalances that cause seizures.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is more common in children who also have cognitive deficits. Some researchers have suggested that seizure disorder is more common when the child has shown a regression or loss of skills. There are different types and subtypes of seizures and a child with autism may experience more than one type. The easiest to recognize are large “grand mal” (or tonic-clonic) seizures. Others include “petit mal” (or absence) seizures and subclinical seizures, which may only be apparent in an EEG (electroencephalogram). It is not clear whether subclinical seizures have effects on language, cognition and behavior. The seizures associated with autism usually start either early in childhood or during adolescence, but may occur at any time.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned that your child may be having seizures, you should see a neurologist. The neurologist may order tests that may include an EEG, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), a CT (Computed Axial Tomography) and a CBC (Complete Blood Count). Children and adults with epilepsy are typically treated with anticonvulsants or seizure medicines to reduce or eliminate occurrences. If your child has epilepsy, you will work closely with a neurologist to find the medicine (or combination of medicines) that works the best with the fewest side effects and to learn the best ways to ensure your child’s safety during a seizure.\r\n<h3>Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders</h3>\r\nMany parents report gastrointestinal (GI) problems in their children with autism. The exact prevalence of gastrointestinal problems such as gastritis, chronic constipation, colitis and esophagitis in individuals with autism is unknown. Surveys have suggested that between 46 and 85% of children with autism have problems such as chronic constipation or diarrhea. One study identified a history of gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abnormal pattern of bowel movements, frequent constipation, frequent vomiting and frequent abdominal pain) in 70% of the children with autism.\r\n\r\nIf your child has similar symptoms, you will want to consult a gastroenterologist, preferably one who works with people with autism. Your child’s physician may be able to help you find an appropriate specialist. Pain caused by GI issues is sometimes recognized because of a change in a child’s behavior, such as an increase in self-soothing behaviors like rocking or outbursts of aggression or self-injury. Bear in mind that your child may not have the language skills to communicate the pain caused by GI issues. Treating GI problems may result in improvement in your child’s behavior. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some children may be helped by dietary intervention for GI issues, including the elimination of dairy and gluten containing foods.\r\n\r\nAs with any treatment, it is best to consult your child’s physician to develop a comprehensive plan. In January 2010, Autism Speaks initiated a campaign to inform pediatricians about the diagnosis and treatment of GI problems associated with autism. Is your child having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping through the night?\r\n\r\n<strong>Sleep problems</strong> are common in children and adolescents with autism. Having a child with sleep problems can affect the whole family. It can also have an impact on the ability of your child to benefit from therapy. Sometimes sleep issues may be caused by medical issues such as obstructive sleep apnea or gastroesophageal reflux and addressing the medical issues may solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, when there is no medical cause, sleep issues may be managed with behavioral interventions including “sleep-hygiene” measures, such as limiting the amount of sleep during the day and establishing regular bedtime routines. There is some evidence of abnormality of melatonin regulation in children with autism. While melatonin may be effective for improving the ability of children with autism to fall asleep, more research is needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>\r\n\r\nMany children with autism experience unusual responses to sensory stimuli or input. These responses are due to difficulty in processing and integrating sensory information. Vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, the sense of movement (vestibular system) and the sense of position (proprioception) can all be affected. This means that while information is sensed normally, it may be perceived much differently. Sometimes stimuli that seem “normal” to others can be experienced as painful, unpleasant or confusing by a child with Sensory Integration Dysfunction (SID), the clinical term for this characteristic. (SID may also be called Sensory Processing Disorder or Sensory Integration Disorder.) SIDs can involve hypersensitivity (also known as sensory defensiveness) or hyposensitivity. An example of hypersensitivity would be an inability to tolerate wearing clothing, being touched or being in a room with normal lighting. Hyposensitivity might be apparent in a child’s increased tolerance for pain or a constant need for sensory stimulation.\r\n\r\nTreatment for Sensory Integration Dysfunction is usually addressed with occupational therapy and/or sensory integration therapy. Pica Pica is an eating disorder involving eating things that are not food. Children between 18 and 24 months of age often eat nonfood items, but this is typically a normal part of development. Some children with autism and other developmental disabilities persist beyond the developmentally typical timeframe and continue to eat items such as dirt, clay, chalk or paint chips.\r\n\r\nChildren showing signs of persistent mouthing of fingers or objects, including toys, should be tested for elevated blood levels of lead, especially if there is a known potential for environmental exposure to lead. You should speak to your doctor about these concerns so he or she can help you with treatment. Your child’s doctor will help you to assess if your child needs a behavioral intervention or if it is something that can be managed at home.\r\n<h3>Mental health</h3>\r\nOftentimes a child diagnosed with ASD may receive an additional diagnosis such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD and anxiety are quite common and addressing these diagnoses properly can help your child make great strides. Recent studies suggest that 1 in 5 children on the autism spectrum also has ADHD and 30% struggle with an anxiety disorder such as social phobia, separation anxiety, panic disorder and specific phobias. The classic symptoms of ADHD include chronic problems with inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. However, these or similar symptoms can likewise result from autism.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is important that evaluation be made by someone with expertise in both disorders. A recent study found that just 1 in 10 children with autism and ADHD was receiving medication to relieve the ADHD symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn regards to anxiety, children with autism express anxiety or nervousness in many of the same ways as typically developing children. Understandably, many individuals with ASD have trouble communicating how they feel. Outward manifestations may be the best clues. In fact, some experts suspect that outward symptoms of anxiety – such as sweating and acting out – may be especially prominent among those with ASD. This can include a racing heart, muscular tensions and stomachaches. It is important for your child to be evaluated by a professional who has expertise in both autism and anxiety so he or she can provide the best treatment options for your child.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.

The outcome of which is extremely poor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong>: where a single dose of a single remedy is given and will give you the <strong>best results</strong>. But please make sure that your homeopath is not giving you and charging for placebo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptom specific treatments</strong>: where only the symptoms or the effects of autism are treated. This will also give very poor results. This is also called HOMEO-ALLOPATHY.\r\n\r\n<strong>Classical homeopathy</strong> has been used with some success to alleviate symptoms, both mental and physical, or to cure individuals with autism. For many parents who have seen a large overall improvement in their autistic children, homeopathy has played a major role.\r\n\r\nIn traditional classical homeopathy remedy selection has been based on trying to address the person in totality looking at the following:\r\n<div class="page" title="Page 1">\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Behaviors</li>\r\n 	<li>Physical Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Emotional Symptoms</li>\r\n 	<li>Genetic weaknesses (also identified as miasms or constitutions)</li>\r\n 	<li>Environmental factors such as vaccinations, drugs or other environmental toxinsIf the remedy is correctly selected based on the whole individual then improvement is seen in all areas. Based on the idea that our own individual weaknesses leave us susceptible to disease, the vital force weakness is addressed to restore true, global health. In autistic individuals homeopathy is trying to determine the individual’s susceptibility to autism to both cure and prevent a re-occurrence of symptoms.In classical homeopathy there is no set protocol such as in the Timeline or Sequential methods. Although the potentized forms of vaccines have been commonly used to successfully treat ASD individuals, it is advised that we always take a full case and give the remedy that most closely matches the individual’s expression of their disease or suffering at that time. It is also understood that while the vaccine remedy may help with the effects of the vaccine, that once that clear has been done, we might then uncover the underlying susceptibility which indicates the individual’s sensitivity to the vaccine in the first place.Even though there is a relatively high rate of cure with ADD/HD individuals, it is still believed that a full recovery from autism through homeopathy is not usual. However, many homeopaths see big improvements in the symptoms and behaviors of ASD individuals, even if a complete recovery is not cited. It is generally thought in the homeopathic community that starting treatment as early as possible improves the chance of a successful recovery from autism. Ideally treatment should begin before age 5. It is often observed that as children with ASD age, they seem to get further and further away from us and it is harder to bring them back. Cases are also often complicated by other interventions such as allopathic drugs, vaccinations, behavioral therapies, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="layoutArea">\r\n<div class="column">\r\n\r\nMost homeopaths see curing autism as a long term project that can take months or even years as they try different remedies in their quest to understand the individual well enough to select the true similimum. Sometimes there is an element of trial and error as the homeopath experiments with different remedies and potencies in order to find one that resonates with the child. When they do find a remedy that resonates then the effect is usually quite evident and significant improvements can be seen. Homeopaths will ask parents to not introduce any other treatments or interventions in the earlier stages of homeopathy so they can observe the direct effects of the homeopathic treatment.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mrpz7rQZuk8\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>About Autism: Why Was My Child Diagnosed with Autism? And What Does It Mean?</h3>\r\nYour child has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and you have asked for help. This is an important turning point in a long journey. For some families, it may be the point when, after a long search for answers, you now have a name for something you didn’t know what to call, but you knew existed. Perhaps you suspected autism, but held out hope that an evaluation would prove otherwise. Many families report mixed feelings of sadness and relief when their child is diagnosed. You may feel completely overwhelmed. You may also feel relieved to know that the concerns you have had for your child are valid. Whatever it is you feel, know that thousands of parents share this journey. You are not alone. There is reason to hope. There is help. Now that you have the diagnosis, the question is, where do you go from here?\r\n\r\nThe Autism Speaks 100 Day Kit was created to help you make the best possible use of the next 100 days in the life of your child. It contains information and advice collected from trusted and respected experts on autism and parents like you.\r\n<h3>Why Does My Child Need a Diagnosis of Autism?</h3>\r\nParents are usually the first to notice the early signs of autism. You probably noticed that your child was developing differently from his or her peers. The differences may have existed from birth or may have become more noticeable later. Sometimes, the differences are severe and obvious to everyone. In other cases, they are more subtle and are first recognized by a daycare provider or preschool teacher. Those differences, the symptoms of autism, have led thousands of parents like you to seek answers that have resulted in a diagnosis of autism. You may wonder: Why does my child need a diagnosis of autism? That’s a fair question to ask - especially when right now, no one is able to offer you a cure. Autism Speaks is dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. Great strides have been made and the current state of progress is a far cry from the time when parents were given no hope for their children.\r\n\r\nSome of the most brilliant minds of our time have turned their attention toward this disorder. It is important to remember that your child is the same unique, lovable, wonderful person he or she was before the diagnosis. There are, however, several reasons why having a diagnosis is important for your child. A thorough and detailed diagnosis provides important information about your child’s behavior and development. It can help create a roadmap for treatment by identifying your child’s specific strengths and challenges and providing useful information about which needs and skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>How is Autism Diagnosed?</h3>\r\nPresently, we don’t have a medical test that can diagnose autism. As the symptoms of autism vary, so do the routes to obtaining a diagnosis. You may have raised questions with your pediatrician. Some children are identified as having developmental delays before obtaining a diagnosis of autism and may already receive some Early Intervention or Special Education services. Unfortunately, parents’ concerns are sometimes not taken seriously by their doctor and as a result, a diagnosis is delayed. Autism Speaks and other autism-related organizations are working hard to educate parents and physicians, so that children with autism are identified as early as possible.\r\n\r\nYour child may have been diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician, a neurologist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. In some cases, a team of specialists may have evaluated your child and provided recommendations for treatment. The team may have included an audiologist to rule out hearing loss, a speech &amp; language therapist to determine language skills and needs and an occupational therapist to evaluate physical and motor skills. A multi-disciplinary evaluation is important for diagnosing autism and other challenges that often accompany autism, such as delays in motor skills.\r\n\r\nIf your child has not been evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team, you will want to make sure further evaluations are conducted so that you can learn as much as possible about your child’s individual strengths and needs.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received a formal diagnosis, it is important to make sure that you ask for a comprehensive report that includes the diagnosis in writing, as well as recommendations for treatment. The doctor may not be able to provide this for you at the appointment, as it may take some time to compile, but be sure to follow up and pick up this helpful necessary report as soon as it’s available. skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.\r\n<h3>What is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (commonly referred to as the DSM-5), all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD.\r\n\r\nPreviously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger Syndrome. The DSM is the main diagnostic reference used by mental health professionals and insurance providers in the United States. You may also hear the terms Classic Autism or Kanner’s Autism (named after the first psychiatrist to describe autism) used to describe the most severe form of the disorder.\r\n\r\nUnder the current DSM-5, the diagnosis of autism requires that at least six developmental and behavioral characteristics are observed, that problems are present before the age of three and that there is no evidence of certain other conditions that are similar.\r\n<h4>There are two domains where people with ASD must show persistent deficits:</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><em>persistent social communication and social interaction </em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior </em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMore specifically, people with ASD must demonstrate (either in the past or in the present) deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction and deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they must show at least two types of repetitive patterns of behavior, including stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, insistence on sameness or inflexible adherence to routines, highly restricted, fixated interests, hyper or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment. Symptoms can be currently present or reported in past history.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the diagnosis, each person evaluated will also be described in terms of any known genetic cause (e.g. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome), level of language and intellectual disability and presence of medical conditions such as seizures, anxiety, depression and/or gastrointestinal (GI) problems.\r\n\r\nThe DSM-5 has an additional category called Social Communication Disorder (SCD). This allows for a diagnosis of disabilities in social communication, without the presence of repetitive behavior. SCD is a new diagnosis and much more research and information is needed. There are currently few guidelines for the treatment of SCD. Until such guidelines become available, treatments that target socialcommunication, including many autism-specific interventions, should be provided to individuals with SCD.\r\n<h3>How Common is Autism?</h3>\r\nAutism statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released in March 2014 identify around 1 in 68 American children as on the autism spectrum – a ten-fold increase in prevalence in 40 years. Careful research shows that this increase is only partly explained by improved diagnosis and awareness. Studies also show that autism is four to five times more common among boys than girls. An estimated 1 out of 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls are diagnosed with autism in the United States.\r\n\r\nASD affects over 2 million individuals in the U.S. and tens of millions worldwide. Moreover, government autism statistics suggest that prevalence rates have increased 10% to 17% annually in recent years. There is no established explanation for this continuing increase, although improved diagnosis and environmental influences are two reasons often considered.\r\n<h3>What Causes Autism?</h3>\r\nNot long ago, the answer to this question would have been “we have no idea.” Research is now delivering the answers. First and foremost, we now know that there is no one cause of autism, just as there is no one type of autism. Over the last five years, scientists have identified a number of rare gene changes or mutations associated with autism. Research has identified more than 100 autism risk genes. In around 15% of cases, a specific genetic cause of a person’s autism can be identified. However, most cases involve a complex and variable combination of genetic risk and environmental factors that influence early brain development. In other words, in the presence of a genetic predisposition to autism, a number of non-genetic or environmental influences further increase a child’s risk.\r\n\r\nThe clearest evidence of these environmental risk factors involves events before and during birth. They include advanced parental age at time of conception (both mom and dad), maternal illness during pregnancy, extreme prematurity, very low birth weight and certain difficulties during birth, particularly those involving periods of oxygen deprivation to the baby’s brain. Mothers exposed to high levels of pesticides and air pollution may also be at higher risk of having a child with ASD.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that these factors, <em>by themselves</em>, do not cause autism. Rather, in combination with genetic risk factors, they appear to modestly increase risk. A small but growing body of research suggests that autism risk is lower among children whose mothers took prenatal vitamins (containing folic acid) in the months before and after conception. Increasingly, researchers are looking at the role of the immune system in autism. Autism Speaks is working to increase awareness and investigation of these and other issues where further research has the potential to improve the lives of those who struggle with autism.\r\n\r\nWhile the causes of autism are complex, it is abundantly clear that it is not caused by bad parenting. Dr. Leo Kanner, the psychiatrist who first described autism as a unique condition in 1943, believed that it was caused by cold, unloving mothers. Bruno Bettelheim, a renowned professor of child development, perpetuated this misinterpretation of autism. Their promotion of the idea that unloving mothers caused their children’s autism created a generation of parents who carried the tremendous burden of guilt for their child’s disability.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Dr. Bernard Rimland, the father of a son with autism who later founded the Autism Society of America and the Autism Research Institute, helped the medical community understand that autism is a biological disorder and is not caused by cold parents.\r\n<h3>More Information about Symptoms of Autism</h3>\r\nAutism affects the way an individual perceives the world and makes communication and social interaction difficult. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social-interaction difficulties, communication challenges and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors. However, symptoms and their severity vary widely across these three core areas. Taken together, they may result in relatively mild challenges for someone on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum.\r\n\r\nFor others, symptoms may be more severe, as when repetitive behaviors and lack of spoken language interfere with everyday life. It is sometimes said that if you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism. While autism is usually a life long condition, all children and adults benefit from interventions, or therapies, that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities. Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible, the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe long term outcome is highly variable. A small percentage of children lose their diagnosis over time, while others remain severely affected. Many have normal cognitive skills, despite challenges in social and language abilities. Many individuals with autism develop speech and learn to communicate with others. Early intervention can make extraordinary differences in your child’s development. How your child is functioning now may be very different from how he or she will function later on in life.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>The information following on the social symptoms, communication disorders and repetitive behaviors associated with autism is partially taken from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) website.</strong></em>\r\n<h3>Social symptoms</h3>\r\nTypically developing infants are social by nature. They gaze at faces, turn toward voices, grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age. By contrast, most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions. By 8 to 10 months of age, many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names, reduced interest in people and delayed babbling. By toddlerhood, many children with autism have difficulty playing social games, don’t imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone. They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents’ displays of anger or affection in typical ways.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that children with autism are attached to their parents. However, the way they express this attachment can be unusual. To parents, it may seem as if their child is disconnected. Both children and adults with autism also tend to have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues such as a smile, wave or grimace may convey little meaning. To a person who misses these social cues, a statement like “Come here!” may mean the same thing, regardless of whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips.\r\n\r\nWithout the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world can seem bewildering. Many people with autism have similar difficulty seeing things from another person’s perspective. Most five-year-olds understand that other people have different thoughts, feelings and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This, in turn, can interfere with the ability to predict or understand another person’s actions.\r\n\r\nIt is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions. This can take the form of seemingly “immature” behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations. It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior. The tendency to “lose control” may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar, overwhelming or frustrating situations. Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging, hair pulling or self-biting.\r\n\r\nFortunately, children with autism can be taught how to socially interact, use gestures and recognize facial expressions. Also, there are many strategies that can be used to help the child with autism deal with frustration so that he or she doesn’t have to resort to challenging behaviors. We will discuss this later.\r\n<h3>Communication difficulties</h3>\r\nYoung children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling, speaking and learning to use gestures. Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors. Others experience significant language delays and don’t begin to speak until much later. With therapy, however, most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate.\r\n\r\nMany nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures, sign language, electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices. When language begins to develop, people with autism may use speech in unusual ways. Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences. They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over. Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim (echolalia). Many parents assume difficulties expressing language automatically mean their child isn’t able to understand the language of others, but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nIt is important to distinguish between expressive language and receptive language. Children with difficulties in expressive language are often unable to express what they are thinking through language, whereas children with difficulties in receptive language are often unable to understand what others are saying. Therefore, the fact that your child may seem unable to express him or herself through language does not necessarily mean he or she is unable to comprehend the language of others. Be sure to talk to your doctor or look for signs that your child is able to interpret language, as this important distinction will affect the way you communicate with him or her.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand the importance of pragmatics when looking to improve and expand upon your child’s communication skills. Pragmatics are social rules for using language in a meaningful context or conversation. While it is important that your child learns how to communicate through words or sentences, it is also key to emphasize both when and where the specific message should be conveyed. Challenges in pragmatics are a common feature of spoken language difficulties in children with autism. These challenges may become more apparent as your child gets older. Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation. Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject, giving others little chance to comment. In other words, the ordinary “give-and-take” of conversation proves difficult. Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors, failing to pick up on the “kid-speak” that’s common among their peers.\r\n\r\nAnother common difficulty is the inability to understand body language, tone of voice and expressions that aren’t meant to be taken literally. For example, even an adult with autism might interpret a sarcastic “Oh, that’s just great!” as meaning it really is great. Conversely, individuals affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language. Facial expressions, movements and gestures may not match what they are saying. Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings. Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat, robot-like voice. This can make it difficult for others to know what they want and need. This failed communication, in turn, can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior (such as screaming or grabbing) on the part of the person with autism.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs. As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants, challenging behaviors often subside. Children with autism often have difficulty letting others know what they want or need until they are taught how to communicate through speech, gestures or other means.\r\n<h3>Repetitive behaviors</h3>\r\nUnusual repetitive behaviors and/or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism. Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping, rocking, jumping and twirling, arranging and rearranging objects and repeating sounds, words or phrases. Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating, such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes. The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys. Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play. Similarly, some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place. It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine. Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts. Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations or obsessions. These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content (e.g. fans, vacuum cleaners or toilets) or depth of knowledge (e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy). Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers, symbols, dates or science topics. Many children with autism need and demand absolute consistency in their environment.\r\n<h3>Unique Abilities that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nAlong with the challenges that autism involves, you may have noticed that your child also exhibits areas of strength. Although not all children have special talents, it is not uncommon for individuals with autism to have exceptional skills in math, music, art and reading, among others. These areas of expertise can provide great satisfaction and pride for the child with autism. If possible, incorporate your child’s areas of expertise into his or her everyday activities and use them whenever possible as a way for him or her to learn and excel.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>The following is adapted from Sally Ozonoff, Geraldine Dawson and James McPartland’s A Parent’s Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism. </em></strong>\r\n\r\nJust as individuals with autism have a variety of difficulties, they also have some distinctive strengths. Some of the strengths that individuals with autism have may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ability to understand concrete concepts, rules and sequences</li>\r\n 	<li>Strong long term memory skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Math skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Computer skills</li>\r\n 	<li>Musical ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Artistic ability</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to think in a visual way</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to decode written language at an early age (This ability is called Hyperlexia – some children with autism can decode written language earlier than they can comprehend written language.)</li>\r\n 	<li>Honesty – sometimes to a fault</li>\r\n 	<li>Ability to be extremely focused – if they are working on a preferred activity</li>\r\n 	<li>Excellent sense of direction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>“How Can My Child Have Autism When He Seems So Smart?” From Does My Child Have Autism? by Wendy Stone</h4>\r\nRight now you might be thinking about all the things your child with autism learned at a much younger age than other children you know. And yes, you are right: there are also things that children with autism learn on their own much faster than their typically developing peers or siblings.\r\n\r\nFor example, they can be very good at learning to pick out their favorite DVD from a stack, even when it’s not in its case. They may learn at a very young age how to operate the remote controls to the TV and DVD player so that they can rewind their videos to their favorite parts (or fast forward through the parts they don’t like). They can be very creative in figuring out ways to climb up on the counter to reach a cabinet that has their favorite cereal or even how to use the key to unlock the dead bolt on the back door so they can go outside to play on the swing.\r\n\r\nClearly, these are not behaviors that you would even think about trying to teach a two-year-old child. And yet some children with autism somehow manage to acquire these skills on their own. How can we understand this inconsistency between the things children with autism do and don’t learn? How can a child who can’t put different shapes into a shape sorter learn to turn on the TV and DVD player, put a DVD in and push the play button? How can a child who can’t understand a simple direction like “get your coat” figure out how to unlock a door to get outside? What accounts for this unique learning style?\r\n\r\nIn a word: motivation. We all pay attention better to the things that interest us, so we become much more proficient at learning them. Understanding what is motivating to your child (all children are different) will be one of the keys to increasing their learning and their skills. Your child’s special talents may be part of his unique and inherent learning style and nature.\r\n<h3>Physical and Medical Issues that May Accompany Autism</h3>\r\nYou can find more information about autism and epilepsy at autismspeaks.org/family-services/epilepsy. Genetic disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development. These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders. While further study is needed, single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20% of those with ASD.\r\n\r\nSome of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories, the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer your child to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing. The results can help increase awareness of associated medical issues and guide treatment and life planning.\r\n<h3>Seizure disorders</h3>\r\nSeizure Disorder, also called epilepsy, occurs in as many as one third of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy is a brain disorder marked by recurring seizures or convulsions. Experts propose that some of the brain abnormalities that are associated with autism may contribute to seizures. These abnormalities can cause changes in brain activity by disrupting neurons in the brain. Neurons are cells in the brain that process and transmit information and send signals to the rest of the body. Overloads or disturbances in the activity of these neurons can result in imbalances that cause seizures.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is more common in children who also have cognitive deficits. Some researchers have suggested that seizure disorder is more common when the child has shown a regression or loss of skills. There are different types and subtypes of seizures and a child with autism may experience more than one type. The easiest to recognize are large “grand mal” (or tonic-clonic) seizures. Others include “petit mal” (or absence) seizures and subclinical seizures, which may only be apparent in an EEG (electroencephalogram). It is not clear whether subclinical seizures have effects on language, cognition and behavior. The seizures associated with autism usually start either early in childhood or during adolescence, but may occur at any time.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned that your child may be having seizures, you should see a neurologist. The neurologist may order tests that may include an EEG, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), a CT (Computed Axial Tomography) and a CBC (Complete Blood Count). Children and adults with epilepsy are typically treated with anticonvulsants or seizure medicines to reduce or eliminate occurrences. If your child has epilepsy, you will work closely with a neurologist to find the medicine (or combination of medicines) that works the best with the fewest side effects and to learn the best ways to ensure your child’s safety during a seizure.\r\n<h3>Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders</h3>\r\nMany parents report gastrointestinal (GI) problems in their children with autism. The exact prevalence of gastrointestinal problems such as gastritis, chronic constipation, colitis and esophagitis in individuals with autism is unknown. Surveys have suggested that between 46 and 85% of children with autism have problems such as chronic constipation or diarrhea. One study identified a history of gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abnormal pattern of bowel movements, frequent constipation, frequent vomiting and frequent abdominal pain) in 70% of the children with autism.\r\n\r\nIf your child has similar symptoms, you will want to consult a gastroenterologist, preferably one who works with people with autism. Your child’s physician may be able to help you find an appropriate specialist. Pain caused by GI issues is sometimes recognized because of a change in a child’s behavior, such as an increase in self-soothing behaviors like rocking or outbursts of aggression or self-injury. Bear in mind that your child may not have the language skills to communicate the pain caused by GI issues. Treating GI problems may result in improvement in your child’s behavior. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some children may be helped by dietary intervention for GI issues, including the elimination of dairy and gluten containing foods.\r\n\r\nAs with any treatment, it is best to consult your child’s physician to develop a comprehensive plan. In January 2010, Autism Speaks initiated a campaign to inform pediatricians about the diagnosis and treatment of GI problems associated with autism. Is your child having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping through the night?\r\n\r\n<strong>Sleep problems</strong> are common in children and adolescents with autism. Having a child with sleep problems can affect the whole family. It can also have an impact on the ability of your child to benefit from therapy. Sometimes sleep issues may be caused by medical issues such as obstructive sleep apnea or gastroesophageal reflux and addressing the medical issues may solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, when there is no medical cause, sleep issues may be managed with behavioral interventions including “sleep-hygiene” measures, such as limiting the amount of sleep during the day and establishing regular bedtime routines. There is some evidence of abnormality of melatonin regulation in children with autism. While melatonin may be effective for improving the ability of children with autism to fall asleep, more research is needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>\r\n\r\nMany children with autism experience unusual responses to sensory stimuli or input. These responses are due to difficulty in processing and integrating sensory information. Vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, the sense of movement (vestibular system) and the sense of position (proprioception) can all be affected. This means that while information is sensed normally, it may be perceived much differently. Sometimes stimuli that seem “normal” to others can be experienced as painful, unpleasant or confusing by a child with Sensory Integration Dysfunction (SID), the clinical term for this characteristic. (SID may also be called Sensory Processing Disorder or Sensory Integration Disorder.) SIDs can involve hypersensitivity (also known as sensory defensiveness) or hyposensitivity. An example of hypersensitivity would be an inability to tolerate wearing clothing, being touched or being in a room with normal lighting. Hyposensitivity might be apparent in a child’s increased tolerance for pain or a constant need for sensory stimulation.\r\n\r\nTreatment for Sensory Integration Dysfunction is usually addressed with occupational therapy and/or sensory integration therapy. Pica Pica is an eating disorder involving eating things that are not food. Children between 18 and 24 months of age often eat nonfood items, but this is typically a normal part of development. Some children with autism and other developmental disabilities persist beyond the developmentally typical timeframe and continue to eat items such as dirt, clay, chalk or paint chips.\r\n\r\nChildren showing signs of persistent mouthing of fingers or objects, including toys, should be tested for elevated blood levels of lead, especially if there is a known potential for environmental exposure to lead. You should speak to your doctor about these concerns so he or she can help you with treatment. Your child’s doctor will help you to assess if your child needs a behavioral intervention or if it is something that can be managed at home.\r\n<h3>Mental health</h3>\r\nOftentimes a child diagnosed with ASD may receive an additional diagnosis such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD and anxiety are quite common and addressing these diagnoses properly can help your child make great strides. Recent studies suggest that 1 in 5 children on the autism spectrum also has ADHD and 30% struggle with an anxiety disorder such as social phobia, separation anxiety, panic disorder and specific phobias. The classic symptoms of ADHD include chronic problems with inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. However, these or similar symptoms can likewise result from autism.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is important that evaluation be made by someone with expertise in both disorders. A recent study found that just 1 in 10 children with autism and ADHD was receiving medication to relieve the ADHD symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn regards to anxiety, children with autism express anxiety or nervousness in many of the same ways as typically developing children. Understandably, many individuals with ASD have trouble communicating how they feel. Outward manifestations may be the best clues. In fact, some experts suspect that outward symptoms of anxiety – such as sweating and acting out – may be especially prominent among those with ASD. This can include a racing heart, muscular tensions and stomachaches. It is important for your child to be evaluated by a professional who has expertise in both autism and anxiety so he or she can provide the best treatment options for your child.\r\n<h2>What homeopathy costs?</h2>\r\nYour first consultation with a private homeopath will usually cost between INR 500 to INR 10,000. Further appointments usually cost less – about INR 500 to INR 5000 depending on the location of the place and experience of homeopath. It will also depend on the skill level of his staff or assistants who usually take the first case and prepare it for the main consultant.\r\n\r\nYour remedy will usually be included in the consultation price, but do check this first. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around INR 100 to INR500 if you need to buy them separately in India.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_2341" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" src="http://imperialclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DR.-KHEDEKAR.-KHEDEKAR-300x167.png" alt="" width="300" height="167" /> Imperial clinics Mumbai[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b><a href="http://imperialclinics.com/dr-shreepad-khedekar-imperial-clinics-autism-spectrum">Dr. Shreepad A.
